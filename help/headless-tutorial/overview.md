# AEM Headless tutorials

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) has multiple options for defining headless endpoints and delivering its content as JSON. Use hands-on tutorials to explore how to use the various options and chose what's right for you.

>[!TIP]

>This collection of tutorials are designed for those who prefer to **learn by doing**. If you prefer learning concepts from the ground up, check out the [AEM Headless Developer Journey](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/headless-journey/developer/overview.html).
