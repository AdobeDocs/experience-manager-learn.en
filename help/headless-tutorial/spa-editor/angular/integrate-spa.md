# Integrate a SPA {#integrate-spa}

Understand how the source code for a Single Page Application (SPA) written in Angular can be integrated with an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Project. Learn to use modern front-end tools, like a webpack dev server, to rapidly develop the SPA against the AEM JSON model API.

## Objective

1. Understand how the SPA project is integrated with AEM with client-side libraries.
2. Learn how to use a local development server for dedicated front-end development.
3. Explore the use of a **proxy** and static **mock** file for developing against the AEM JSON model API

## What you will build

This chapter will add a simple `Header` component to the SPA. In the process of building out this static `Header` component several approaches to AEM SPA development are used.

*The SPA is extended to add a static `Header` component*

## Prerequisites

Review the required tooling and instructions for setting up a [local development environment](overview.md#local-dev-environment).

### Get the code

1. Download the starting point for this tutorial via Git:

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa.git
    $ cd aem-guides-wknd-spa
    $ git checkout Angular/integrate-spa-start
    ```

2. Deploy the code base to a local AEM instance using Maven:

    ```shell
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
    ```

    If using [AEM 6.x](overview.md#compatibility) add the `classic` profile:

    ```shell
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Pclassic
    ```

You can always view the finished code on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa/tree/Angular/integrate-spa-solution) or check the code out locally by switching to the branch `Angular/integrate-spa-solution`.

## Integration approach {#integration-approach}

Two modules were created as part of the AEM project: `ui.apps` and `ui.frontend`.

The `ui.frontend` module is a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) project that contains all of the SPA source code. A majority of the SPA development and testing is done in the webpack project. When a production build is triggered, the SPA is built and compiled using webpack. The compiled artifacts (CSS and Javascript) are copied into the `ui.apps` module which is then deployed to the AEM runtime.

![ui.frontend high-level architecture](assets/integrate-spa/ui-frontend-architecture.png)

*A high-level depiction of the SPA integration.*

Additional information about the Front-end build can be [found here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-angular.html).

## Inspect the SPA integration {#inspect-spa-integration}

Next, inspect the `ui.frontend` module to understand the SPA that has been auto-generated by the [AEM Project archetype](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-angular.html).

1. In the IDE of your choice open up the AEM Project for the WKND SPA. This tutorial will use the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/development-tools.html#microsoft-visual-studio-code).

    ![VSCode - AEM WKND SPA Project](./assets/integrate-spa/vscode-ide-openproject.png)

2. Expand and inspect the `ui.frontend` folder. Open the file `ui.frontend/package.json`

3. Under the `dependencies` you should see several related to `@angular`:

    ```json
    "@angular/animations": "~9.1.11",
    "@angular/common": "~9.1.11",
    "@angular/compiler": "~9.1.11",
    "@angular/core": "~9.1.11",
    "@angular/forms": "~9.1.10",
    "@angular/platform-browser": "~9.1.10",
    "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "~9.1.10",
    "@angular/router": "~9.1.10",
    ```

    The `ui.frontend` module is an [Angular application](https://angular.io) generated by using the [Angular CLI tool](https://angular.io/cli) that includes routing.

4. There are also three dependencies prefixed with `@adobe`:

    ```json
    "@adobe/cq-angular-editable-components": "^2.0.2",
    "@adobe/cq-spa-component-mapping": "^1.0.3",
    "@adobe/cq-spa-page-model-manager": "^1.1.3",
    ```

    The above modules make up the [AEM SPA Editor JS SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/headless/spas/spa-blueprint.html) and provide the functionality to make it possible to map SPA Components to AEM Components.

5. In the `package.json` file several `scripts` are defined:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "start": "ng serve --open --proxy-config ./proxy.conf.json",
        "build": "ng lint && ng build && clientlib",
        "build:production": "ng lint && ng build --prod && clientlib",
        "test": "ng test",
        "sync": "aemsync -d -w ../ui.apps/src/main/content"
    }
    ```

    These scripts are based on common [Angular CLI commands](https://angular.io/cli/build) but have been modified slightly to work with the larger AEM project.

    `start` - runs the Angular app locally using a local web server. It has been updated to proxy the content of local AEM instance.

    `build` - compiles the Angular app for production distribution. The addition of `&& clientlib` is responsible for copying the compiled SPA into the `ui.apps` module as a client-side library during a build. The npm module [aem-clientlib-generator](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) is used to facilitate this.

    More details about the available scripts can be found [here](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-angular.html).

6. Inspect the file `ui.frontend/clientlib.config.js`. This configuration file is used by [aem-clientlib-generator](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator#clientlibconfigjs) to determine how to generate the client library.

7. Inspect the file `ui.frontend/pom.xml`. This file transforms the `ui.frontend` folder into a [Maven module](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html). The `pom.xml` file has been updated to use the [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) to **test** and **build** the SPA during a Maven build.

8. Inspect the file `app.component.ts` at `ui.frontend/src/app/app.component.ts`:

    ```js
    import { Constants } from '@adobe/cq-angular-editable-components';
    import { ModelManager } from '@adobe/cq-spa-page-model-manager';
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

    @Component({
    selector: '#spa-root', // tslint:disable-line
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'],
    templateUrl: './app.component.html'
    })
    export class AppComponent {
        ...

        constructor() {
            ModelManager.initialize().then(this.updateData);
        }

        private updateData = pageModel => {
            this.path = pageModel[Constants.PATH_PROP];
            this.items = pageModel[Constants.ITEMS_PROP];
            this.itemsOrder = pageModel[Constants.ITEMS_ORDER_PROP];
        }
    }
    ```

    `app.component.js` is the entrypoint of the SPA. `ModelManager` is provided by the AEM SPA Editor JS SDK. It is responsible for calling and injecting the `pageModel` (the JSON content) into the application.

## Add a Header component {#header-component}

Next, add a new component to the SPA and deploy the changes to a local AEM instance to see the integration.

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `ui.frontend` folder:

    ```shell
    $ cd aem-guides-wknd-spa/ui.frontend
    ```

2. Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli#installing-angular-cli) globally This is used to generate Angular components as well as to build and serve the Angular application via the **ng** command.

    ```shell
    $ npm install -g @angular/cli
    ```

    >[!CAUTION]
    >
    > The version of **@angular/cli** used by this project is **9.1.7**. It is recommended to keep the the Angular CLI versions in sync.

3. Create a new `Header` component by running the Angular CLI `ng generate component` command from within the `ui.frontend` folder.

    ```shell
    $ ng generate component components/header

    CREATE src/app/components/header/header.component.css (0 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/components/header/header.component.html (21 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/components/header/header.component.spec.ts (628 bytes)
    CREATE src/app/components/header/header.component.ts (269 bytes)
    UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (1809 bytes)
    ```

    This will create a skeleton for the new Angular Header component at `ui.frontend/src/app/components/header`.

4. Open the `aem-guides-wknd-spa` project in the IDE of your choice. Navigate to the `ui.frontend/src/app/components/header` folder.

    ![Header Component Path in the IDE](assets/integrate-spa/header-component-path.png)

5. Open the file `header.component.html` and replace the contents with the following:

    ```html
    <!--/* header.component.html */-->
    <header className="header">
        <div className="header-container">
            <h1>WKND</h1>
        </div>
    </header>
    ```

    Note this displays static content, so this Angular component does not require any adjustments to the default generated `header.component.ts`.

6. Open the file **app.component.html** at  `ui.frontend/src/app/app.component.html`. Add the `app-header`:

    ```html
    <app-header></app-header>
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    ```

    This will include the `header` component above all the page content.

7. Open a new terminal and navigate into the `ui.frontend` folder and run the `npm run build` command:

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm run build

    Linting "angular-app"...
    All files pass linting.
    Generating ES5 bundles for differential loading...
    ES5 bundle generation complete.
    ```

8. Navigate to the `ui.apps` folder. Beneath `ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/wknd-spa-angular/clientlibs/clientlib-angular` you should see the compiled SPA files have been copied from  the`ui.frontend/build` folder.

    ![Client library generated in ui.apps](assets/integrate-spa/compiled-spa-uiapps.png)

9. Return to the terminal and navigate into the `ui.apps` folder. Execute the following Maven command:

    ```shell
    $ cd ../ui.apps
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
    ...
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time:  9.629 s
    [INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-04T17:48:07-07:00
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    This will deploy the `ui.apps` package to a local running instance of AEM.

10. Open a browser tab and navigate to [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html). You should now see the contents of the `Header` component being displayed in the SPA.

    ![Initial header implementation](assets/integrate-spa/initial-header-implementation.png)

    Steps **7-9** are executed automatically when triggering a Maven build from the root of the project (i.e `mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage`). You should now understand the basics of the integration between the SPA and AEM client-side libraries. Notice that you can still edit and add `Text` components in AEM, however the `Header` component is not editable.

## Webpack Dev Server - Proxy the JSON API {#proxy-json}

As seen in the previous exercises, performing a build and syncing the client library to a local instance of AEM takes a few minutes. This is acceptable for final testing, but is not ideal for the majority of the SPA development.

A [webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) can be used to rapidly develop the SPA. The SPA is driven by a JSON model generated by AEM. In this exercise the JSON content from a running instance of AEM is **proxied** into the development server configured by the [Angular project](https://angular.io/guide/build).

1. Return to the IDE and open the file **proxy.conf.json** at `ui.frontend/proxy.conf.json`.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "context": [
                        "/content/**/*.(jpg|jpeg|png|model.json)",
                        "/etc.clientlibs/**/*"
                    ],
            "target": "http://localhost:4502",
            "auth": "admin:admin",
            "logLevel": "debug"
        }
    ]
    ```

    The [Angular app](https://angular.io/guide/build#proxying-to-a-backend-server) provides an easy mechanism to proxy API requests. The patterns specified in `context` are be proxied through `localhost:4502`, the local AEM quickstart.

2. Open the file **index.html** at `ui.frontend/src/index.html`. This is the root HTML file used by the dev server.

    Note there is an entry for `base href="/"`. The [base tag](https://angular.io/guide/deployment#the-base-tag) is critical for the app to resolve relative URLs.

    ```html
    <base href="/">
    ```

3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `ui.frontend` folder. Run the command `npm start`:

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm start

    > wknd-spa-angular@0.1.0 start /Users/dgordon/Documents/code/aem-guides-wknd-spa/ui.frontend
    > ng serve --open --proxy-config ./proxy.conf.json

    ℹ ｢wds｣: 404s will fallback to //index.html
    ```

4. Open a new browser tab (if not already opened) and navigate to [http://localhost:4200/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4200/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html).

    ![Webpack dev server - proxy json](assets/integrate-spa/webpack-dev-server-1.png)

    You should see the same content as in AEM, but without any of the authoring capabilities enabled.

5. Return to the IDE and create a new folder named `img` at `ui.frontend/src/assets`.
6. Download and add the following WKND logo to the `img` folder:

    ![WKND logo](./assets/integrate-spa/wknd-logo-dk.png)

7. Open **header.component.html** at `ui.frontend/src/app/components/header/header.component.html` and include the logo:

    ```html
    <header class="header">
        <div class="header-container">
            <div class="logo">
                <img class="logo-img" src="assets/img/wknd-logo-dk.png" alt="WKND SPA" />
            </div>
        </div>
    </header>
    ```

    Save the changes to **header.component.html**.

8. Return to the browser. You should immediately see the changes to the app reflected.

    ![Logo added to header](assets/integrate-spa/added-logo-localhost.png)

    You can continue to make content updates in **AEM** and see them reflected in **webpack dev server**, since we are proxying the content. Note that the content changes are only visible in the **webpack dev server**.

9. Stop the local web server with `ctrl+c` in the terminal.

## Webpack Dev Server - Mock JSON API {#mock-json}

Another approach to rapid development is to use a static JSON file to act as the JSON model. By "mocking" the JSON, we remove the dependency on a local AEM instance. It also allows a front-end developer to update the JSON model in order to test functionality and drive changes to the JSON API that would then be later implemented by a back-end developer.

The initial set up of the mock JSON does **require a local AEM instance**.

1. In the browser navigate to [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en.model.json](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en.model.json).

    This is the JSON exported by AEM that is driving the application. Copy the JSON output.

2. Return to the IDE navigate to `ui.frontend/src` and add new folders named **mocks** and **json** to match the following folder structure:

    ```plain
    |-- ui.frontend
        |-- src
            |-- mocks
                |-- json
    ```

3. Create a new file named **en.model.json** beneath `ui.frontend/public/mocks/json`. Paste the JSON output from **Step 1** here.

    ![Mock Model Json file](assets/integrate-spa/mock-model-json-created.png)

4. Create a new file **proxy.mock.conf.json** beneath `ui.frontend`. Populate the file with the following:

    ```json
    [
        {
        "context": [
            "/content/**/*.model.json"
        ],
        "pathRewrite": { "^/content/wknd-spa-angular/us" : "/mocks/json"} ,
        "target": "http://localhost:4200",
        "logLevel": "debug"
        }
    ]
    ```

    This proxy configuration will rewrite requests that start with `/content/wknd-spa-angular/us` with `/mocks/json` and serve the corresponding static JSON file, for example:

    ```plain
    /content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en.model.json -> /mocks/json/en.model.json
    ```

5. Open the file **angular.json**. Add a new **dev** configuration with an updated **assets** array to reference the **mocks** folder created.

    ```json
     "dev": {
              "assets": [
                "src/mocks",
                "src/assets",
                "src/favicon.ico",
                "src/logo192.png",
                "src/logo512.png",
                "src/manifest.json"
              ]
        },
    ```

    ![Angular JSON Dev Assets Update Folder](assets/integrate-spa/dev-assets-update-folder.png)

    Creating a dedicated **dev** configuration ensures that the **mocks** folder is only used during development and is never deployed to AEM in a production build.

6. In the **angular.json** file, next update the **browserTarget** configuration to use the new **dev** configuration:

    ```diff
      ...
      "serve": {
          "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
          "options": {
    +       "browserTarget": "angular-app:build:dev"
    -       "browserTarget": "angular-app:build"
          },
      ...
    ```

    ![Angular JSON build dev update](assets/integrate-spa/angular-json-build-dev-update.png)

7. Open the file `ui.frontend/package.json` and add a new **start:mock** command to reference the **proxy.mock.conf.json** file.

    ```diff
        "scripts": {
            "start": "ng serve --open --proxy-config ./proxy.conf.json",
    +       "start:mock": "ng serve --open --proxy-config ./proxy.mock.conf.json",
            "build": "ng lint && ng build && clientlib",
            "build:production": "ng lint && ng build --prod && clientlib",
            "test": "ng test",
            "sync": "aemsync -d -w ../ui.apps/src/main/content"
        }
    ```

    Adding a new command makes it easy to toggle between the proxy configurations.

8. If currently running, stop the **webpack dev server**. Start the **webpack dev server** using the **start:mock** script:

    ```shell
    $ npm run start:mock

    > wknd-spa-angular@0.1.0 start:mock /Users/dgordon/Documents/code/aem-guides-wknd-spa/ui.frontend
    > ng serve --open --proxy-config ./proxy.mock.conf.json
    ```

    Navigate to [http://localhost:4200/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4200/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html) and you should see the same SPA but the content is now being pulled from the **mock** JSON file.

9. Make a small change to the **en.model.json** file created earlier. The updated content should immediately be reflected in the **webpack dev server**.

    ![mock model json update](./assets/integrate-spa/webpack-mock-model.gif)

    Being able to manipulate the JSON model and see the effects on a live SPA can help a developer understand the JSON model API. It also allows both front-end and back-end development happen in parallel.

## Add Styles with Sass

Next, some style updated are added to the project. This project will add [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) support for a few useful features like variables.

1. Open a terminal window and stop the **webpack dev server** if started. From inside the `ui.frontend` folder enter the following command to update the Angular app to process **.scss** files.

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ ng config schematics.@schematics/angular:component.styleext scss
    ```

    This will update the `angular.json` file with a new entry at the bottom of the file:

    ```json
    "schematics": {
        "@schematics/angular:component": {
        "styleext": "scss"
        }
    }
    ```

2. Install `normalize-scss` to normalize the styles across browsers:

    ```shell
    $ npm install normalize-scss --save
    ```

3. Return to the IDE and beneath `ui.frontend/src` create a new folder named `styles`.
4. Create a new file beneath `ui.frontend/src/styles` named `_variables.scss` and populate it with the following variables:

    ```scss
    //_variables.scss

    //== Colors
    //
    //## Gray and brand colors for use across theme.

    $black:                  #202020;
    $gray:                   #696969;
    $gray-light:             #EBEBEB;
    $gray-lighter:           #F7F7F7;
    $white:                  #FFFFFF;
    $yellow:                 #FFEA00;
    $blue:                   #0045FF;


    //== Typography
    //
    //## Font, line-height, and color for body text, headings, and more.

    $font-family-sans-serif:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    $font-family-serif:       Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    $font-family-base:        $font-family-sans-serif;
    $font-size-base:          18px;

    $line-height-base:        1.5;
    $line-height-computed:    floor(($font-size-base * $line-height-base));

    // Functional Colors
    $brand-primary:             $yellow;
    $body-bg:                   $white;
    $text-color:                $black;
    $text-color-inverse:        $gray-light;
    $link-color:                $blue;

    //Layout
    $max-width: 1024px;
    $header-height: 75px;

    // Spacing
    $gutter-padding: 12px;
    ```

5. Re-name the extension of the file **styles.css** at `ui.frontend/src/styles.css` to **styles.scss**. Replace the contents with the following:

    ```scss
    /* styles.scss * /

    /* Normalize */
    @import '~normalize-scss/sass/normalize';

    @import './styles/variables';

    body {
        background-color: $body-bg;
        font-family: $font-family-base;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-size: $font-size-base;
        text-align: left;
        color: $text-color;
        line-height: $line-height-base;
    }

    body.page {
        max-width: $max-width;
        margin: 0 auto;
        padding: $gutter-padding;
        padding-top: $header-height;
    }
    ```

6. Update **angular.json** and re-name all references to **style.css** with **styles.scss**. There should be 3 references.

    ```diff
      "styles": [
    -    "src/styles.css"
    +    "src/styles.scss"
       ],
    ```

## Update Header styles

Next add some brand-specific styles to the **Header** component using Sass.

1. Start the **webpack dev server** to see the styles updating in real-time:

    ```shell
    $ npm run start:mock
    ```

2. Under `ui.frontend/src/app/components/header` re-name **header.component.css** to **header.component.scss**. Populate the file with the following:

    ```scss
    @import "~src/styles/variables";

    .header {
        width: 100%;
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left:0;
        z-index: 99;
        background-color: $brand-primary;
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);
    }

    .header-container {
        display: flex;
        max-width: $max-width;
        margin: 0 auto;
        padding-left: $gutter-padding;
        padding-right: $gutter-padding;
    }

    .logo {
        z-index: 100;
        display: flex;
        padding-top: $gutter-padding;
        padding-bottom: $gutter-padding;
    }

    .logo-img {
        width: 100px;
    }
    ```

3. Update **header.component.ts** to reference **header.component.scss**:

    ```diff
    ...
      @Component({
        selector: 'app-header',
        templateUrl: './header.component.html',
    -   styleUrls: ['./header.component.css']
    +   styleUrls: ['./header.component.scss']
      })
    ...
    ```

4. Return to the browser and the **webpack dev server**:

    ![Styled Header - webpack dev server](assets/integrate-spa/styled-header.png)

    You should now see the updated styles added to the **Header** component.

## Deploy SPA updates to AEM

The changes made to the **Header** are currently only visible through the **webpack dev server**. Deploy the updated SPA to AEM to see the changes.

1. Stop the **webpack dev server**.
2. Navigate to the root of the project `/aem-guides-wknd-spa` and deploy the project to AEM using Maven:

    ```shell
    $ cd ..
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
    ```

3. Navigate to [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-angular/us/en/home.html). You should see the updated **Header** with logo and styles applied:

    ![Updated Header in AEM](assets/integrate-spa/final-header-component.png)

    Now that the updated SPA is in AEM, authoring can continue.

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}

Congratulations, you have updated the SPA and explored the integration with AEM! You now know two different approaches for developing the SPA against the AEM JSON model API using a **webpack dev server**.

You can always view the finished code on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa/tree/Angular/integrate-spa-solution) or check the code out locally by switching to the branch `Angular/integrate-spa-solution`.
