# Getting Started with AEM Headless - GraphQL

An end-to-end tutorial illustrating how to build-out and expose content using AEM's GraphQL APIs and consumed by an external app, in a headless CMS scenario.

This tutorial explores how AEM's GraphQL APIs and headless capabilities can be used to power the experiences surfaced in an external app.

This tutorial covers the following topics:

* Create a Project Configuration
* Create Content Fragment Models to model data
* Create Content Fragments based on the previously made models.
* Explore how Content Fragments in AEM can be queried using the integrated GraphiQL development tool.
* To store or persist the GraphQL queries to AEM
* Consume persisted GraphQL queries from a sample React app

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The following are required to follow this tutorial:

*   Basic HTML and JavaScript skills
*   The following tools must be installed locally:
    * [Node.js v18](https://nodejs.org/)
    * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    * An IDE (for example, [Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### AEM Environment

To complete this tutorial, AEM Administrator access to an AEM as a Cloud Service environment is recommended. If you do not have access to AEM as a Cloud Service environment, you can use the [Local AEM as a Cloud Service Quickstart SDK](/help/cloud-service/local-development-environment/aem-runtime.md). However, it is important to note that some product UI screens such as Content Fragment navigation is different.

## Let's get started!

Start the tutorial with [Defining Content Fragment Models](content-fragment-models.md).

## GitHub Project

The source code, and content packages are available on the [AEM Guides - WKND GraphQL GitHub Project](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-graphql).

If you find an issue with the tutorial or the code, leave a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-graphql/issues).
