# Getting Started with AEM Headless - GraphQL

An end-to-end tutorial illustrating how to build-out and expose content using AEM's GraphQL APIs and consumed by an external app, in a headless CMS scenario.

This tutorial explores how AEM's GraphQL APIs and headless capabilities can be used to power the experiences surfaced in an external app.

This tutorial will cover the following topics:

* Create Content Fragment Models to model Contributors in AEM
* Author Contributor Content Fragments using the newly created Content Fragment Model
* Explore how how Content Fragments in AEM can be queried using the integrated GraphiQL development tool.
* Consume AEM's GraphQL APIs from a sample WKND GraphQL React app
* Perform advanced data modeling with Fragment References
