# Defining Content Fragment Models {#content-fragment-models}

In this chapter, learn how to model content and build a schema with **Content Fragment Models**. You learn about the different data types that can be used to define a schema as part of the model.

We create two simple models, **Team** and **Person**. The **Team** data model has name, short name, and description and references the **Person** data model, which has full name, bio details, profile picture, and occupations list.

You are also welcome to create your own model following the basic steps and tweak the respective steps like GraphQL queries, and React App code or simply follow the steps outlined in these chapters.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This is a multi-part tutorial and it is assumed that an [AEM author environment is available](./overview.md#prerequisites).

## Objectives {#objectives}

* Create a Content Fragment Model.
* Identify available data types and validation options for building models.
* Understand how the Content Fragment Model defines **both** the data schema and the authoring template for a Content Fragment.

## Create a project configuration

A project configuration contains all Content Fragment models associated with a particular project and provides a means of organizing models. At least one project must be created **before** creating Content Fragment Model.

1.  Login to the AEM **Author** environment (ex. `https://author-pYYYY-eXXXX.adobeaemcloud.com/`)
1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **Configuration Browser**.

    ![Navigate to Configuration Browser](assets/content-fragment-models/navigate-config-browser.png)
1.  Click **Create**, in the top-right corner
1.  In the resulting dialog, enter:

    * Title*: **My Project**
    * Name*: **my-project** (prefer to use all lowercase using hyphens to separate words. This string influences the unique GraphQL endpoint that client applications perform requests against.)
    * Check **Content Fragment Models**
    * Check **GraphQL Persistent Queries**

    ![My Project Configuration](assets/content-fragment-models/my-project-configuration.png)

## Create Content Fragment Models

Next, create two models for a **Team** and a **Person**.

### Create the Person Model

Create a model for a **Person**, which is the data model representing a person that is part of a team.

1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **Content Fragment Models**.

    ![Navigate to Content Fragment Models](assets/content-fragment-models/navigate-cf-models.png)

1.  Navigate into the **My Project** folder.
1.  Tap **Create** in the top-right corner to bring up the **Create Model** wizard.
1.  In **Model Title** field, enter **Person** and tap **Create**. In the resulting dialog, tap **Open**, to build the model.

1.  Drag and Drop a **Single line text** element on to the main panel. Enter the following properties on the **Properties** tab:

    * **Field Label**: **Full Name**
    * **Property Name**: `fullName`
    * Check **Required**

    ![Full Name property field](assets/content-fragment-models/full-name-property-field.png)

    The **Property Name** defines the name of the property that is persisted to AEM. The **Property Name** also defines the **key** name for this property as part of the data schema. This **key** is used when the Content Fragment data is exposed via GraphQL APIs.

1.  Tap the **Data Types** tab and drag and drop a **Multi line text** field beneath the **Full Name** field. Enter the following properties:

    * **Field Label**: **Biography**
    * **Property Name**: `biographyText`
    * **Default Type**: **Rich Text**

1.  Click the **Data Types** tab and drag and drop a **Content Reference** field. Enter the following properties:

    * **Field Label**: **Profile Picture**
    * **Property Name**: `profilePicture`
    * **Root Path**: `/content/dam`

    When configuring the **Root Path**, you can click the **folder** icon to bring up a modal to select the path. This restricts which folders authors can use to populate the path. `/content/dam` is the root in which all AEM Assets (images, videos, other Content Fragments) are stored.

1.  Add a validation to the **Picture Reference** so that only content types of **Images** can be used to populate the field.

    ![Restrict to Images](assets/content-fragment-models/picture-reference-content-types.png)

1.  Click the **Data Types** tab and drag and drop an **Enumeration**  data type beneath the **Picture Reference** field. Enter the following properties:

    * **Render As**: **Checkboxes**
    * **Field Label**: **Occupation**
    * **Property Name**: `occupation`

1.  Add several **Options** using the **Add an option** button. Use the same value for **Option Label** and **Option Value**:

    **Artist**, **Influencer**, **Photographer**, **Traveler**, **Writer**, **YouTuber**

1.  The final **Person** model should look like the following:

    ![Final Person Model](assets/content-fragment-models/final-author-model.png)

1.  Click **Save** to save the changes.

### Create the Team Model

Create a model for a **Team**, which is the data model for a team of people. The Team model references the Person model to represent the members of the team.

1.  In the **My Project** folder, tap **Create** in the upper right corner to bring up the **Create Model** wizard.
1.  In **Model Title** field, enter **Team** and tap **Create**.

    Tap **Open** in the resulting dialog, to open the newly created model.

1.  Drag and Drop a **Single line text** element on to the main panel. Enter the following properties on the **Properties** tab:

    * **Field Label**: **Title**
    * **Property Name**: `title`
    * Check **Required**

1.  Tap the **Data Types** tab and drag and Drop a **Single line text** element on to the main panel. Enter the following properties on the **Properties** tab:

    * **Field Label**: **Short Name**
    * **Property Name**: `shortName`
    * Check **Required**
    * Check **Unique**
    * Under, **Validation Type** > choose **Custom**
    * Under, **Custom Validation Regex** > enter `^[a-z0-9\-_]{5,40}$` - this ensures that only lowercase alphanumeric values and dashes from 5 through 40 characters can be entered.

    The `shortName` property provides us a way to query an individual team based on a shortened path. The **Unique** setting ensures that the value is always unique per Content Fragment of this model.

1.  Tap the **Data Types** tab and drag and drop a **Multi line text** field beneath the **Short Name** field. Enter the following properties:

    * **Field Label**: **Description**
    * **Property Name**: `description`
    * **Default Type**: **Rich Text**

1.  Click the **Data Types** tab and drag and drop a **Fragment Reference** field. Enter the following properties:

    * **Render As**: **Multiple Field**
    * **Field Label**: **Team Members**
    * **Property Name**: `teamMembers`
    * **Allowed Content Fragment Models**: Use the folder icon to select the **Person** model.

1.  The final **Team** model should look like the following:

    ![Final Team Model](assets/content-fragment-models/final-team-model.png)

1.  Click **Save** to save the changes.

1.  You should now have two models to work from:

    ![Two Models](assets/content-fragment-models/two-new-models.png)

## Publish Project Configuration & Content Fragment Models

Upon review and verification, publish the `Project Configuration` & `Content Fragment Model`

1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **Configuration Browser**.

1.  Tap the checkbox next to **My Project** and tap **Publish**

    ![Publish Project Config](assets/content-fragment-models/publish-project-config.png)

1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **Content Fragment Models**.

1.  Navigate into the **My Project** folder.

1.  Tap **Person** and **Team** models and tap **Publish**

    ![Publish Content Fragment Models](assets/content-fragment-models/publish-content-fragment-model.png)

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}

Congratulations, you just created your first Content Fragment Models!

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

In the next chapter, [Authoring Content Fragment Models](author-content-fragments.md), you create and edit a new Content Fragment based on a Content Fragment Model. You also learn how to create variations of Content Fragments.
