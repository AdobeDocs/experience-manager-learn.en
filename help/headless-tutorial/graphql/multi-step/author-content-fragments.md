# Authoring Content Fragment {#authoring-content-fragments}

In this chapter, you create and edit a new Content Fragment based on the [newly defined Content Fragment Model](./content-fragment-models.md). You also learn how to create variations of Content Fragments.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This is a multi-part tutorial and it is assumed that the steps outlined in the [Defining Content Fragment Models](./content-fragment-models.md) have been completed.

## Objectives {#objectives}

* Author a Content Fragment based on a Content Fragment Model
* Create a Content Fragment variation

## Create an Asset Folder

Content Fragments are stored in folders in AEM Assets. To create Content Fragments from the models created in the previous chapter, a folder must be created to store them. A configuration is required on the folder to enable creation of fragments from specific models.

1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Assets** > **Files**.

    ![Navigate to assets files](assets/author-content-fragments/navigate-assets-files.png)

1.  Tap **Create** in the top-right corner and tap **Folder**. In the resulting dialog, enter:

    * Title*: **My Project**
    * Name: **my-project**

    ![Create Folder dialog](assets/author-content-fragments/create-folder-dialog.png)

1.  Select the **My Folder** folder and tap **Properties**.

    ![Open folder properties](assets/author-content-fragments/open-folder-properties.png)

1.  Tap the **Cloud Services** tab. Under the Cloud Configuration tab, use the path finder to select the **My Project** configuration. The value should be `/conf/my-project`.

    ![Set Cloud Config](assets/author-content-fragments/set-cloud-config-my-project.png)

    Setting this property enables Content Fragments to be created using the models created in the previous chapter.

1.  Tap the **Policies** tab, under the **Allowed Content Fragment Models** field use the path finder to select the **Person** and **Team** model created earlier.

    ![Allowed content Fragment Models](assets/author-content-fragments/allowed-content-fragment-models.png)

    These policies are inherited by any subfolders automatically and can be overridden. You can also allow models by tags or enable models from other project configurations. This mechanism provides a powerful way to manage your content hierarchy.

1.  Tap **Save & Close** to save the changes to the folder properties.

1.  Navigate inside the **My Project** folder.

1.  Create another folder with the following values:

    * Title*: **English**
    * Name: **en**

    A best practice is to set up projects for multilingual support. See [the following docs page for more information](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/admin/translate-assets.html).


## Create a Content Fragment {#create-content-fragment}

>[!TIP]
>
>For local AEM SDK users: Utilize the AEM Assets UI to create and author Content Fragments, instead of the Content Fragments UI outlined below. For detailed instructions, refer to the [AEM documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing.html).

Next several Content Fragments are created based on the **Team** and **Person** models.

1.  From the AEM Start Screen, tap **Content Fragments** to open up the Content Fragments UI.

    ![Content Fragment UI](assets/author-content-fragments/cf-fragment-ui.png)

1.  In the left-hand rail, expand **My Project** and tap **English**.
1.  Tap **Create** to bring up the **New Content Fragment** dialog and enter the following values:

    * Location: `/content/dam/my-project/en`
    * Content Fragment model: **Person**
    * Title: **John Doe**
    * Name: `john-doe`

    ![New Content Fragment](assets/author-content-fragments/new-content-fragment-john-doe.png)
1.  Tap **Create**.
1.  Repeat the above steps to create a fragment representing **Alison Smith**:

    * Location: `/content/dam/my-project/en`
    * Content Fragment model: **Person**
    * Title: **Alison Smith**
    * Name: `alison-smith`

    Tap **Create** to create the Person fragment.

1.  Next, repeat the steps to create a **Team** fragment representing **Team Alpha**:

    * Location: `/content/dam/my-project/en`
    * Content Fragment model: **Team**
    * Title: **Team Alpha**
    * Name: `team-alpha`

    Tap **Create** to create the Team fragment.

1.  There should be three Content Fragments beneath **My Project** > **English**:

    ![New Content Fragments](assets/author-content-fragments/new-content-fragments.png)

## Edit Person Content Fragments {#edit-person-content-fragments}

Next populate the newly created fragments with data.

1.  Tap the checkbox next to **John Doe** and tap **Open**.

    ![Open Content Fragment](assets/author-content-fragments/open-fragment-for-editing.png)

1.  The Content Fragment Editor contains a form based on the Content Fragment model. Fill out the various fields to add content to the **John Doe** fragment. For Profile Picture, upload your own image to AEM Assets.

    ![Content Fragment editor](assets/author-content-fragments/content-fragment-editor-jd.png)

1.  Tap **Save & Close** to save the changes to the John Doe fragment.
1.  Return to the Content Fragment UI and open the **Alison Smith** file for editing.
1.  Repeat the above steps to populate the **Alison Smith** fragment with content.

## Edit Team Content Fragment {#edit-team-content-fragment}

1.  Open the **Team Alpha** Content Fragment using the Content Fragment UI.
1.  Fill out the fields for **Title**, **Short Name**, and **Description**.
1.  Select the **John Doe** and **Alison Smith** Content Fragments to populate the **Team Members** field:

    ![Set Team members](assets/author-content-fragments/select-team-members.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also create Content Fragments in-line by using the **New Content Fragment** button.

1.  Tap **Save & Close** to save the changes to the Team Alpha fragment.

## Publish Content Fragments

>[!TIP]
>
>For local AEM SDK users: Utilize the AEM Assets UI to publish Content Fragments, instead of the Content Fragments UI outlined below. For detailed instructions, refer to the [AEM documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing.html#publishing-and-referencing-a-fragment).

Upon review and verification, publish the authored `Content Fragments`

1.  From the AEM Start Screen, tap **Content Fragments** to open up the Content Fragments UI.

1.  In the left-hand rail, expand **My Project** and tap **English**.

1.  Tap the checkbox next to the content fragments and tap **Publish**.
    ![Publish Content Fragment](assets/author-content-fragments/publish-content-fragment.png)

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}

Congratulations, you authored multiple Content Fragments and created a variation.

## Next Steps {#next-steps}

In the next chapter, [Explore GraphQL APIs](explore-graphql-api.md), you will explore AEM's GraphQL APIs using the built-in GrapiQL tool. Learn how AEM automatically generates a GraphQL schema based on a Content Fragment model. You will experiment constructing basic queries using the GraphQL syntax.
