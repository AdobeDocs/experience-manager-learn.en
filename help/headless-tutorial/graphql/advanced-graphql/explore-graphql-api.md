# Explore the AEM GraphQL API

The GraphQL API in AEM allows you to expose Content Fragment data to downstream applications. In the basic tutorial [multi-step GraphQL tutorial](../multi-step/explore-graphql-api.md), you used the GraphiQL Explorer to test and refine the GraphQL queries. 

In this chapter, you use the GraphiQL Explorer to define more advanced queries to gather data of the Content Fragments that you created in the [previous chapter](../advanced-graphql/author-content-fragments.md).

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

This document is part of a multi-part tutorial. Please ensure that the previous chapters have been completed before proceeding with this chapter.

## Objectives {#objectives}

In this chapter, you learn how to:

* Filter a list of Content Fragments with references using query variables
* Filter for content within a fragment reference
* Query for inline content and fragment references from a multi-line text field
* Query using directives
* Query for the JSON Object content type

## Using the GraphiQL Explorer


The [GraphiQL Explorer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/headless/graphql-api/graphiql-ide.html) tool enables developers to create, and test queries against content on the current AEM environment. The GraphiQL tool also enables users to **persist or save** queries to be used by client applications in a production setting.

Next, explore the power of AEM's GraphQL API using the built-in GraphiQL Explorer.

1.  From the AEM Start screen, navigate to **Tools** > **General** > **GraphQL Query Editor**.

    ![Navigate to the GraphiQL IDE](assets/explore-graphql-api/navigate-graphql-query-editor.png)

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >In, some versions of AEM (6.X.X) the GraphiQL Explorer (aka GraphiQL IDE) tool needs to be manually installed, follow [instruction from here](../how-to/install-graphiql-aem-6-5.md).

1.  In the top-right corner, make sure that the Endpoint is set to **WKND Shared Endpoint**. Changing the _Endpoint_ dropdown value here displays the existing _Persisted Queries_ in the top-left corner.

    ![Set GraphQL Endpoint](assets/explore-graphql-api/set-wknd-shared-endpoint.png)

  This will scope all queries to models created in the **WKND Shared** project.


## Filter a list of Content Fragments using query variables

In the previous [multi-step GraphQL tutorial](../multi-step/explore-graphql-api.md), you defined, and used, basic persisted queries to get Content Fragments data. Here, you expand this knowledge and filter Content Fragments data by passing variables to the persisted queries. 

When developing client applications, usually you need to filter Content Fragments based on dynamic arguments. The AEM GraphQL API allows you to pass these arguments as variables in a query in order to avoid string construction on the client side at runtime. For more information on GraphQL variables, see the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables).

For this example, query all Instructors that have a particular skill.

1.  In the GraphiQL IDE, paste the following query into the left panel:

    ```graphql
    query listPersonBySkill ($skillFilter: String!){
      personList(
        _locale: "en"
        filter: {skills: {_expressions: [{value: $skillFilter}]}}
      ) {
        items {
          fullName
          contactInfo {
            phone
            email
          }
          profilePicture {
            ... on ImageRef {
              _path
            }
          }
          biography {
            plaintext
          }
          instructorExperienceLevel
          skills
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The `listPersonBySkill` query above accepts one variable (`skillFilter`) that is a required `String`. This query performs a search against all Person Content Fragments and filters them based on the `skills` field and the string that is passed in `skillFilter`.

    The `listPersonBySkill` includes the `contactInfo` property, which is a fragment reference to the Contact Info model defined in the previous chapters. The Contact Info model contains `phone` and `email` fields. At least one of these fields in the query must be present for it to perform correctly.

    ```graphql
    contactInfo {
            phone
            email
          }
    ```

1.  Next, let's define `skillFilter` and get all Instructors that are proficient in skiing. Paste the following JSON string in the Query Variables panel in the GraphiQL IDE:

    ```json
    {
        "skillFilter": "Skiing"
    }
    ```

1.  Execute the query. The result should look similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "personList": {
          "items": [
            {
              "fullName": "Stacey Roswells",
              "contactInfo": {
                "phone": "209-888-0011",
                "email": "sroswells@wknd.com"
              },
              "profilePicture": {
                "_path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/contributors/stacey-roswells.jpg"
              },
              "biography": {
                "plaintext": "Stacey Roswells is an accomplished rock climber and alpine adventurer. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Stacey is the youngest of six children. Stacey's father was a lieutenant colonel in the US Navy and mother was a modern dance instructor. Stacey's family moved frequently with father's duty assignments and took the first pictures when father was stationed in Thailand. This is also where Stacey learned to rock climb."
              },
              "instructorExperienceLevel": "Advanced",
              "skills": [
                "Rock Climbing",
                "Skiing",
                "Backpacking"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  Press the **Play** button in the top menu to execute the query. You should see the results of the content fragments from the previous chapter:

  ![Person by Skill Results](assets/explore-graphql-api/person-by-skill.png)    

## Filter for content within a fragment reference

The AEM GraphQL API allows you to query nested Content Fragments. In the previous chapter, you added three new fragment references to an Adventure Content Fragment: `location`, `instructorTeam`, and `administrator`. Now, let's filter all Adventures for any Administrator that has a particular name.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>Only one model must be allowed as reference for this query to perform correctly.

1.  In the GraphiQL IDE, paste the following query into the left panel:

    ```graphql
    query getAdventureAdministratorDetailsByAdministratorName ($name: String!){
      adventureList(
      _locale: "en"
        filter: {administrator: {fullName: {_expressions: [{value: $name}]}}}
      ) {
        items {
          title
          administrator {
            fullName
            contactInfo {
              phone
              email
            }
            administratorDetails {
              json
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1.  Next, paste the following JSON string in the Query Variables panel:

    ```json
    {
        "name": "Jacob Wester"
    }
    ```

    The `getAdventureAdministratorDetailsByAdministratorName` query filters all Adventures for any `administrator` of `fullName` "Jacob Wester", returning information from across two nested Content Fragments: Adventure and Instructor.

1.  Execute the query. The result should look similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "adventureList": {
          "items": [
            {
              "title": "Yosemite Backpacking",
              "administrator": {
                "fullName": "Jacob Wester",
                "contactInfo": {
                  "phone": "209-888-0000",
                  "email": "jwester@wknd.com"
                },
                "administratorDetails": {
                  "json": [
                    {
                      "nodeType": "paragraph",
                      "content": [
                        {
                          "nodeType": "text",
                          "value": "Jacob Wester has been coordinating backpacking adventures for three years."
                        }
                      ]
                    }
                  ]
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Query for inline references from a multi-line text field {#query-rte-reference}

The AEM GraphQL API allows you to query for content and fragment references within multi-line text fields. In the previous chapter, you added both reference types into the **Description** field of the Yosemite Team Content Fragment. Now, let's retrieve these references.

1.  In the GraphiQL IDE, paste the following query into the left panel:

    ```graphql
    query getTeamByAdventurePath ($fragmentPath: String!){
      adventureByPath (_path: $fragmentPath) {
        item {
          instructorTeam {
            _metadata {
              stringMetadata {
                name
                value
              }
          }
            teamFoundingDate
            description {
              plaintext
            }
          }
        }
        _references {
          ... on ImageRef {
            __typename
            _path
          }
          ... on LocationModel {
            __typename
            _path
            name
            address {
              streetAddress
              city
              zipCode
              country
            }
            contactInfo {
              phone
              email
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The `getTeamByAdventurePath` query filters all Adventures by path and returns data for the `instructorTeam` fragment reference of a specific Adventure.

    `_references` is a system-generated field that is used to reveal references, including those that are inserted into multi-line text fields. 
    
    The `getTeamByAdventurePath` query retrieves multiple references. First, it uses the built-in `ImageRef` object to retrieve the `_path` and `__typename` of images inserted as content references into the multi-line text field. Next, it uses `LocationModel` to retrieve the data of the Location Content Fragment inserted into the same field.

    The query also includes the `_metadata` field. This allows you to retrieve the name of the Team Content Fragment and display it later in the WKND app.

1.  Next, paste the following JSON string in the Query Variables panel to get the Yosemite Backpacking Adventure:

    ```json
    {
        "fragmentPath": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/yosemite-backpacking/yosemite-backpacking"
    }
    ```

1.  Execute the query. The result should look similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "adventureByPath": {
          "item": {
            "instructorTeam": {
              "_metadata": {
                "stringMetadata": [
                  {
                    "name": "title",
                    "value": "Yosemite Team"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "description",
                    "value": ""
                  }
                ]
              },
              "teamFoundingDate": "2016-05-24",
              "description": {
                "plaintext": "\n\nThe team of professional adventurers and hiking instructors working in Yosemite National Park.\n\nYosemite Valley Lodge"
              }
            }
          },
          "_references": [
            {
              "__typename": "LocationModel",
              "_path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/locations/yosemite-valley-lodge/yosemite-valley-lodge",
              "name": "Yosemite Valley Lodge",
              "address": {
                "streetAddress": "9006 Yosemite Lodge Drive",
                "city": "Yosemite National Park",
                "zipCode": "95389",
                "country": "United States"
              },
              "contactInfo": {
                "phone": "209-992-0000",
                "email": "yosemitelodge@wknd.com"
              }
            },
            {
              "__typename": "ImageRef",
              "_path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/teams/yosemite-team/team-yosemite-logo.png"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The `_references` field reveals both the logo image and the Yosemite Valley Lodge Content Fragment that was inserted into the **Description** field.


## Query using directives

Sometimes when developing client applications, you need to conditionally change the structure of your queries. In this case, the AEM GraphQL API allows you to use GraphQL directives in order to change the behavior of your queries based on the provided criteria. For more information on GraphQL directives, see the [GraphQL documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#directives).

In the [previous section](#query-rte-reference), you learned how to query for inline references within multi-line text fields. The content was retrieved from the `description` filed in the `plaintext` format. Next, let's expand that query and use a directive to conditionally retrieve `description` in the `json` format as well.

1.  In the GraphiQL IDE, paste the following query into the left panel:

    ```graphql
    query getTeamByAdventurePath ($fragmentPath: String!, $includeJson: Boolean!){
      adventureByPath(_path: $fragmentPath) {
        item {
          instructorTeam {
            _metadata{
              stringMetadata{
                name
                value
              }
            }
            teamFoundingDate
            description {
              plaintext
              json @include(if: $includeJson)
            }
          }
        }
        _references {
          ... on ImageRef {
            __typename
            _path
          }
          ... on LocationModel {
            __typename
            _path
            name
            address {
              streetAddress
              city
              zipCode
              country
            }
            contactInfo {
              phone
              email
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The query above accepts one more variable (`includeJson`) that is a required `Boolean`, also known as the query's directive. A directive can be used to conditionally include data from the `description` field in the `json` format based on the boolean that is passed in `includeJson`.

1.  Next, paste the following JSON string in the Query Variables panel:

    ```json
    {
      "fragmentPath": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/yosemite-backpacking/yosemite-backpacking",
      "includeJson": false
    }
    ```

1.  Execute the query. You should get the same result as in the previous section on [how to query for inline references within multi-line text fields](#query-rte-reference). 

1.  Update the `includeJson` directive to `true` and execute the query again. The result should look similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "adventureByPath": {
          "item": {
            "instructorTeam": {
              "_metadata": {
                "stringMetadata": [
                  {
                    "name": "title",
                    "value": "Yosemite Team"
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "description",
                    "value": ""
                  }
                ]
              },
              "teamFoundingDate": "2016-05-24",
              "description": {
                "plaintext": "\n\nThe team of professional adventurers and hiking instructors working in Yosemite National Park.\n\nYosemite Valley Lodge",
                "json": [
                  {
                    "nodeType": "paragraph",
                    "content": [
                      {
                        "nodeType": "reference",
                        "data": {
                          "path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/teams/yosemite-team/team-yosemite-logo.png",
                          "mimetype": "image/png"
                        }
                      }
                    ]
                  },
                  {
                    "nodeType": "paragraph",
                    "content": [
                      {
                        "nodeType": "text",
                        "value": "The team of professional adventurers and hiking instructors working in Yosemite National Park."
                      }
                    ]
                  },
                  {
                    "nodeType": "paragraph",
                    "content": [
                      {
                        "nodeType": "reference",
                        "data": {

                          "type": "fragment"
                        },
                        "value": "Yosemite Valley Lodge"
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ]

                "phone": "209-992-0000",
                "email": "yosemitelodge@wknd.com"
              }
            },
            {
              "__typename": "ImageRef",
              "_path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/teams/yosemite-team/team-yosemite-logo.png"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

## Query for the JSON Object content type

Remember that in the previous chapter on authoring Content Fragments, you added a JSON object into the **Weather by Season** field. Let's now retrieve that data within the Location Content Fragment.

1.  In the GraphiQL IDE, paste the following query into the left panel:

    ```graphql
    query getLocationDetailsByLocationPath ($fragmentPath: String!) {
      locationByPath(_path: $fragmentPath) {
        item {
          name
          description {
            json
          }
          contactInfo {
            phone
            email
          }
          locationImage {
            ... on ImageRef {
              _path
            }
          }
          weatherBySeason
          address {
            streetAddress
            city
            state
            zipCode
            country
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1.  Next, paste the following JSON string in the Query Variables panel:

    ```json
    {
      "fragmentPath": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/locations/yosemite-national-park/yosemite-national-park"
    }
    ```

1.  Execute the query. The result should look similar to the following:

    ```json
    {
      "data": {
        "locationByPath": {
          "item": {
            "name": "Yosemite National Park",
            "description": {
              "json": [
                {
                  "nodeType": "paragraph",
                  "content": [
                    {
                      "nodeType": "text",
                      "value": "Yosemite National Park is in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. It's famous for its gorgeous waterfalls, giant sequoia trees, and iconic views of El Capitan and Half Dome cliffs."
                    }
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "nodeType": "paragraph",
                  "content": [
                    {
                      "nodeType": "text",
                      "value": "Hiking and camping are the best ways to experience Yosemite. Numerous trails provide endless opportunities for adventure and exploration."
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            },
            "contactInfo": {
              "phone": "209-999-0000",
              "email": "yosemite@wknd.com"
            },
            "locationImage": {
              "_path": "/content/dam/wknd-shared/en/adventures/locations/yosemite-national-park/yosemite-national-park.jpeg"
            },
            "weatherBySeason": {
              "summer": "81 / 89°F",
              "fall": "56 / 83°F",
              "winter": "46 / 51°F",
              "spring": "57 / 71°F"
            },
            "address": {
              "streetAddress": "9010 Curry Village Drive",
              "city": "Yosemite Valley",
              "state": "CA",
              "zipCode": "95389",
              "country": "United States"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    The `weatherBySeason` field contains the JSON object added in the previous chapter.

## Query for all content at once

So far, multiple queries have been executed to illustrate the capabilities of the AEM GraphQL API. 

The same data could be retrieved with only a single query and this query is later used in the client application to retrieve additional information such as location, team name, team members of an adventure:

```graphql
query getAdventureDetailsBySlug($slug: String!) {
  adventureList(filter: {slug: {_expressions: [{value: $slug}]}}) {
    items {
      _path
      title
      activity
      adventureType
      price
      tripLength
      groupSize
      difficulty
      primaryImage {
        ... on ImageRef {
          _path
          mimeType
          width
          height
        }
      }
      description {
        html
        json
      }
      itinerary {
        html
        json
      }
      location {
        _path
        name
        description {
          html
          json
        }
        contactInfo {
          phone
          email
        }
        locationImage {
          ... on ImageRef {
            _path
          }
        }
        weatherBySeason
        address {
          streetAddress
          city
          state
          zipCode
          country
        }
      }
      instructorTeam {
        _metadata {
          stringMetadata {
            name
            value
          }
        }
        teamFoundingDate
        description {
          json
        }
        teamMembers {
          fullName
          contactInfo {
            phone
            email
          }
          profilePicture {
            ... on ImageRef {
              _path
            }
          }
          instructorExperienceLevel
          skills
          biography {
            html
          }
        }
      }
      administrator {
        fullName
        contactInfo {
          phone
          email
        }
        biography {
          html
        }
      }
    }
    _references {
      ... on ImageRef {
        _path
        mimeType
      }
      ... on LocationModel {
        _path
        __typename
      }
    }
  }
}


# in Query Variables
{
  "slug": "yosemite-backpacking"
}
```

## Congratulations!

Congratulations! You have now tested advanced queries to gather data of the Content Fragments that you created in the previous chapter.

## Next steps

In the [next chapter](/help/headless-tutorial/graphql/advanced-graphql/graphql-persisted-queries.md), you will learn how to persist GraphQL queries and why it is best practice to use persisted queries in your applications.
