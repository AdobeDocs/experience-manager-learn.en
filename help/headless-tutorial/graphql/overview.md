# Getting Started with AEM Headless - GraphQL {#getting-started-with-aem-headless}

{{aem-headless-trials-promo}}

AEM's GraphQL APIs for Content Fragments
supports headless CMS scenarios where external client applications render experiences using content managed in AEM.

A modern content delivery API is key for efficiency and performance of Javascript-based frontend applications. Using a REST API introduce challenges:  

* Large number of requests for fetching one object at a time
* Often "over-delivering" content, meaning the application receives more than it needs

To overcome these challenges GraphQL provides a query-based API allowing clients to query AEM for only the content it needs, and to receive using a single API call.

This video is an overview of the GraphQL API implemented in AEM. The GraphQL API in AEM is primarily designed to deliver AEM Content Fragment's to downstream applications as part of a headless deployment.
