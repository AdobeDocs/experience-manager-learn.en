# Angular app

Explore AEM Headless GraphQL APIs using a simple Angular app. This Angular app connects to [wknd.site](https://wknd.site), displays a list of WKND adventures, and provides a details view for each adventure.

This code:

+ Connects to [wknd.site](https://wknd.site)'s AEM Publish service, and does not require authentication
+ Uses the persisted queries: `wknd-shared/adventures-all` and `wknd-shared/adventures-by-slug`
