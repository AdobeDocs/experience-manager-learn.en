# Basic React app

This [React](https://reactjs.org/) app demonstrates how to query content using AEM's GraphQL APIs using persisted queries. This application renders a filterable of WKND Adventures, and upon selecting an adventure, displays the adventures full details.

This code:

+ Connects to an AEM Publish service, and does not require authentication
+ Uses the WKND's persisted queries: `wknd-shared/adventures-all` and `wknd-shared/adventures-by-slug`

For a more indepth review of how this Next.js app is built, review the [example React app documentation](../example-apps/react-app.md).
