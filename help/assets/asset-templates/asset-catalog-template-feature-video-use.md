* A user can create a Catalog page using a \.indd file. Tagged content within the \.indd file would be available as Editable fields, thereby giving content authors the ability to modify content for these fields.
* Product properties can be mapped to Editable Fields provided their field type matches.
* Catalog pages for similar products can be easily created.
* Ability to merge different catalog pages into a single PDF or \.indd file
