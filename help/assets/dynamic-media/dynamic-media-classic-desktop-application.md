# Using Dynamic Media Classic Desktop Application{#using-dynamic-media-desktop-application}

Adobe introduces a desktop application for Dynamic Media Classic that provides a similar experience to a browser and a functionally equivalent interface that does not depend on Adobe Flash player.

>[!NOTE]
>
> We recommend that you install the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app by October 1, 2020. Doing so will ensure you have a smooth transition before Adobe Flash Player is deprecated on December 31, 2020. On that date, you will no longer be able to log on to the browser version of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic user interface, labeled as Scene7 Publishing System in the product.
