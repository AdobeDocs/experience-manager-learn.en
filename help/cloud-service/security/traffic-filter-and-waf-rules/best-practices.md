# Best practices for traffic filter rules including WAF rules

Learn recommended best practices for configuring traffic filter rules including WAF rules in AEM as a Cloud Service to enhance security and mitigate risks.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The best practices described in this article are not exhaustive and are not intended to be a substitute for your own security policies and procedures.

## General best practices

- Start with the [recommended set](./overview.md#adobe-recommended-rules) of standard traffic filter and WAF rules provided by Adobe, and tweak them based on your application's specific needs and threat landscape.
- Collaborate with your security team to determine which rules align with your organization's security posture and compliance requirements.
- Always test new or updated rules in Development environments before promoting them to Stage and Production.
- When declaring and validating rules, begin with the `action` type `log` to observe behavior without blocking legitimate traffic.
- Move from `log` to `block` only after analyzing sufficient traffic data and confirming that no valid requests are being affected.
- Introduce rules incrementally, involving QA, performance, and security testing teams to identify unintended side effects.
- Regularly review and analyze rule effectiveness using [dashboard tooling](https://github.com/adobe/AEMCS-CDN-Log-Analysis-Tooling). Frequency of review (daily, weekly, monthly) should align with your site's traffic volume and risk profile.
- Continuously refine rules based on new threat intelligence, traffic behavior, and audit results.

## Best practices for traffic filter rules

- Use Adobe [recommended standard traffic filter rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf#recommended-starter-rules) as a baseline, which includes rules for edge, origin protection, and OFAC-based restrictions.
- Review alerts and logs regularly to identify patterns of abuse or misconfiguration.
- Adjust threshold values for rate limits based on your application's traffic patterns and user behavior.

    See the following table for guidance on how to choose the threshold values:

    | Variation  | Value     |
    | :--------- | :------- |
    | Origin    | Take the highest value of the Max Origin Requests per IP/POP under **normal** traffic conditions (that is, not the rate at the time of a DDoS) and increase it by a multiple |
    | Edge    | Take the highest value of the Max Edge Requests per IP/POP under **normal** traffic conditions (that is, not the rate at the time of a DDoS) and increase it by a multiple |

    Also see the [choosing threshold values](../blocking-dos-attack-using-traffic-filter-rules.md#choosing-threshold-values) section for more details.

- Move to `block` action only after confirming that the `log` action does not impact legitimate traffic.

## Best practices for WAF rules

- Start with the Adobe [recommended WAF rules](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf#recommended-nonwaf-starter-rules), which include rules for blocking known bad IPs, detecting DDoS attacks, and mitigating bot abuse.
- The `ATTACK` WAF flag should alert you to potential threats. Make sure that there are no false positives before moving to `block`.
- If recommended WAF rules do not cover specific threats, consider creating custom rules based on your application's unique requirements. See a complete list of [WAF flags](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/security/traffic-filter-rules-including-waf#waf-flags-list) in the documentation.
