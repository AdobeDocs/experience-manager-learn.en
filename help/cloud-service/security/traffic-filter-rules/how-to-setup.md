# How to set up Traffic Filter rules including WAF rules

Learn **how to set up** traffic filter rules, including WAF rules. Read about creating, deploying, testing, and analyzing results.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3425407?quality=12&learn=on)

## Setup

The setup process involves the following:

- _creating rules_ with an appropriate AEM project structure and configuration file.
- _deploying rules_ using Adobe Cloud Manager's configuration pipeline.
- _testing rules_ using various tools to generate traffic.
- _analyzing the results_ using AEMCS CDN logs and dashboard tooling.

### Create rules in your AEM project

To create rules, follow these steps:

1. At the top level of your AEM project, create a folder `config`.

1. Within the `config` folder, create a new file called `cdn.yaml`.

1. Add the following metadata to the `cdn.yaml` file:

```yaml
kind: CDN
version: '1'
metadata:
  envTypes:
    - dev
    - stage
    - prod
data:
  trafficFilters:
    rules:
```

See an example of the `cdn.yaml` file within the AEM Guides WKND Sites Project:

### Deploy rules through Cloud Manager {#deploy-rules-through-cloud-manager}

To deploy the rules, follow these steps:

1. Log into Cloud Manager at [my.cloudmanager.adobe.com](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/) and select the appropriate organization and program.

1. Navigate to the _Pipelines_ card from the _Program Overview_ page and click the **+Add** button and select the desired pipeline type.

    In the example above, for demo purposes _Add Non-Production Pipeline_ is selected since a dev environment is used.

1. In the _Add Non-Production Pipeline_ dialog, choose and enter the following details:

    1. Configuration step:

        - **Type**: Deployment Pipeline
        - **Pipeline Name**: Dev-Config

        ![Cloud Manager Config Pipeline dialog](./assets/cloud-manager-config-pipeline-step1-dialog.png)

    2. Source Code step:

        - **Code to deploy**: Targeted deployment
        - **Include**: Config
        - **Deployment Environment**: Name of your environment, for example, wknd-program-dev.
        - **Repository**: The Git repository from where the pipeline should retrieve the code; for example, `wknd-site`
        - **Git Branch**: The name of the Git repository branch.
        - **Code Location**: `/config`, corresponding to the top-level configuration folder created in the previous step.

### Test rules by generating traffic

To test rules, there are various third-party tools available and your organization may have a preferred tool. For the demo purpose, let's use the following tools:

- [Curl](https://curl.se/) for basic testing like invoking a URL and checking the response code.

- [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta) to perform denial of service (DOS). Follow the installation instructions from the [Vegeta GitHub](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta#install).

- [Nikto](https://github.com/sullo/nikto/wiki) to find potential problems and security vulnerabilities like XSS, SQL injection, and more. Follow installation instructions from the [Nikto GitHub](https://github.com/sullo/nikto).

- Verify that the tools are installed and available in your terminal by running the commands below:

    ```shell
    # Curl version check
    $ curl --version

    # Vegeta version check
    $ vegeta -version

    # Nikto version check
    $ cd <PATH-OF-CLONED-REPO>/program
    ./nikto.pl -Version
    ```

### Analyze results using the dashboard tooling

After creating, deploying, and testing the rules, you can analyze the results using **CDN** logs and **AEMCS-CDN-Log-Analysis-Tooling**. The tooling provides a set of dashboards to visualize the results for Splunk and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) stack.

The tooling can be cloned from the [AEMCS-CDN-Log-Analysis-Tooling](https://github.com/adobe/AEMCS-CDN-Log-Analysis-Tooling) GitHub repository. Then, follow the instructions to install and load the **CDN Traffic Dashboard** and **WAF Dashboard** dashboards for your preferred observability tool.

In this tutorial, let's use the ELK stack. Follow the [ELK Docker container for AEMCS CDN Log Analysis](https://github.com/adobe/AEMCS-CDN-Log-Analysis-Tooling/blob/main/ELK/README.md) instructions to set up the ELK stack.

- After loading the sample dashboard, your Elastic dashboard tool page should look like the following:

    ![ELK Traffic Filter Rules Dashboard](./assets/elk-dashboard.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>    As there are no AEMCS CDN logs ingested yet, the dashboard is empty.


## Next step
