# SAML 2.0 authentication{#saml-2-0-authentication}

Learn how to set up and authenticate end-users (not AEM authors) to a SAML 2.0 compatible IDP of your choosing.

## What SAML for AEM as a Cloud Service?

SAML 2.0 integration with AEM Publish (or Preview), allows end users of an AEM-based web experience to authenticate to a non-Adobe IDP (Identity Provider), and access AEM as a named, authorized user.

|-----------------------|:----------:|:-----------:|
| SAML 2.0 support      |  &#10008;  | &#10004;    |

+++ Understand the SAML 2.0 flow with AEM

The typical flow of an AEM Publish SAML integration is as follows:

1. User makes a request to AEM Publish the indicates authentication is required.
    + User requests a CUGs/ACL protected resource.
    + User requests a resource that is subject to an Authentication Requirement.
    + User follows a link to AEM's login endpoint (i.e. `/system/sling/login`) that explicitly requests the login action.
1. AEM makes an AuthnRequest to the IDP, requesting IDP to start authentication process.
1. User authenticates to IDP.
    + User is prompted by the IDP for credentials.
    + User is already authenticated with the IDP and does not have to provide further credentials.
1. IDP generates a SAML assertion containing the user's data, and signs it using the IDP's private certificate.
1. IDP sends the SAML assertion via HTTP POST, by way of the user's web browser, to AEM Publish.
1. AEM Publish receives the SAML assertion, and validates the SAML assertion's integrity and authenticity using the IDP public certificate. 
1. AEM Publish manages the AEM user record based on the SAML 2.0 OSGi configuration, and the contents of the SAML Assertion.
    + Creates user
    + Synchronizes user attributes
    + Updates AEM user group membership
1. AEM Publish sets the AEM `login-token` cookie on the HTTP response, which is used to authenticate subsequent requests to AEM Publish.
1. AEM Publish redirects user to URL on AEM Publish as specified by the `saml_request_path` cookie.

## Configuration walk-through

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/343040?quality=12&learn=on)

This video walks through of setting up SAML 2.0 integration with AEM as a Cloud Service Publish service, and using Okta as the IDP.

## Prerequisites

The following are required when setting up SAML 2.0 authentication:

+ Deployment Manager access to Cloud Manager
+ AEM Administrator access to AEM as a Cloud Service environment
+ Administrator access to the IDP
+ Optionally, access to a public/private keypair used to encryption SAML payloads

SAML 2.0 is only supported to authenticate uses to AEM Publish or Preview. To manage the authentication of AEM Author using and IDP, [integrate the IDP with Adobe IMS](https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/set-up-identity.html).


## Install IDP public certificate on AEM

The IDP's public certificate is added to AEM's Global Trust Store, and used to validate the SAML assertion sent by the IDP is valid.

+++SAML assertion signing flow

![SAML 2.0 - IDP SAML Assertion signing](./assets/saml-2-0/idp-signing-diagram.png)

1. User authenticates to IDP.
1. IDP generates a SAML assertion containing the user's data.
1. IDP signs the SAML assertion using the IDP's private certificate.
1. IDP initiates a client-side HTTP POST to AEM Publish's SAML endpoint (`.../saml_login`) that includes the signed SAML assertion.
1. AEM Publish receives the HTTP POST containing the signed SAML assertion, can validate the signature using the IDP public certificate.

+++

![Add the IDP public certificate to the Global Trust Store](./assets/saml-2-0/global-trust-store.png)

1. Obtain the __public certificate__ file from the IDP. This certificate allows AEM to validate the SAML assertion provided to AEM by the IDP.

    The certificate is in PEM format, and should resemble:

    ```
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIC4jCBAcoCCQC33wnybT5QZDANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAyMQswCQYDVQQGEwJV
    ...
    m0eo2USlSRTVl7QHRTuiuSThHpLKQQ==
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    ```

1. Log in to AEM Author as an AEM Administrator.
1. Navigate to __Tools > Security > Trust Store__.
1. Create or open the Global Trust Store. If creating a Global Trust Store, store the password some place safe.
1. Expand __Add certificate from CER file__.
1. Select __Select Certificate File__, and upload the certificate file provided by the IDP. 
1. Leave __Map Certificate to User__ blank.
1. Select __Submit__.
1. The newly added certificate appears above the __Add certificate from CRT file__ section.
1. Make note of the __alias__, as this value is used in the [SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler OSGi configuration](#saml-2-0-authentication-handler-osgi-configuration).
1. Select __Save & Close__.

The Global Trust Store is configured with the IDP's public certificate on AEM Author, but since SAML is only used on AEM Publish, the Global Trust Store must be replicated to AEM Publish for the IDP public certificate to be accessible there.

![Replicate the Global Trust Store to AEM Publish](./assets/saml-2-0/global-trust-store-replicate.png)

1. Navigate to __Tools > Deployment > Packages__.
1. Create a package
    + Package name: `Global Trust Store`
    + Version: `1.0.0`
    + Group: `com.your.company`
1. Edit the new __Global Trust Store__ package.
1. Select the __Filters__ tab, and add a filter for the root path `/etc/truststore`.
1. Select __Done__ and then __Save__.
1. Select the __Build__ button for the __Global Trust Store__ package.
1. Once built, select __More__ > __Replicate__ to activate the Global Trust Store node (`/etc/truststore`) to AEM Publish.

## Create authentication-service keystore{#authentication-service-keystore}

_Creating a keystore for authentication-service is required when the [SAML 2.0 authentication handler OSGi configuration property `handleLogout` is set to `true`](#saml-20-authenticationsaml-2-0-authentication) or when [AuthnRequest signing/SAML assertion ecryption](#install-aem-public-private-key-pair) is required_

1. Log in to AEM Author as an AEM Administrator, to upload the private key.
1. Navigate to __Tools > Security > Users__, and select __authentication-service__ user, and select __Properties__ from the top action bar.
1. Select the __Keystore__ tab.
1. Create or open the keystore. If creating a keystore, keep the password safe.
    + A [public/private keystore is installed into this keystore](#install-aem-public-private-key-pair) only if AuthnRequest signing/SAML assertion encryption is required.
    + If this SAML integration supports logout, but not AuthnRequest signing/SAML assertion, then an empty keystore is sufficient.
1. Select __Save & Close__.
1. Create a package containing the updated __authentication-service__ user. 

    _Use the following temporary workaround using packages:_

   1. Navigate to __Tools > Deployment > Packages__.
   1. Create a package
       + Package name: `Authentication Service`
       + Version: `1.0.0`
       + Group: `com.your.company`
   1. Edit the new __Authentication Service Key Store__ package.
   1. Select the __Filters__ tab, and add a filter for the root path `/home/users/system/cq:services/internal/security/<AUTHENTICATION SERVICE UUID>/keystore`.
        + The `<AUTHENTICATION SERVICE UUID>` can be found by navigating to __Tools > Security > Users__, and selecting __authentication-service__ user. The UUID is the last part of the URL.
   1. Select __Done__ and then __Save__.
   1. Select the __Build__ button for the __Authentication Service Key Store__ package.
   1. Once built, select __More__ > __Replicate__ to activate the Authentication Service key store to AEM Publish.

## Install AEM public/private key pair{#install-aem-public-private-key-pair}

_Installing the AEM public/private key pair is optional_

AEM Publish can be configured to sign AuthnRequests (to IDP), and encrypt SAML assertions (to AEM). This is achieved by providing a private key to AEM Publish, and it's matching public key to the IDP.

+++ Understand the AuthnRequest signing flow (optional)

The AuthnRequest (the request to the IDP from AEM Publish that initiates the login process) can be signed by AEM Publish. To do this, AEM Publish signs the AuthnRequest using the private key, that the IDP then validates the signature using the public key. This guarantees to the IDP that AuthnRequest was initiated, and requested by AEM Publish, and not a malicious third party.

![SAML 2.0 - SP AuthnRequest signing](./assets/saml-2-0/sp-authnrequest-signing-diagram.png)

1. User makes an HTTP request to AEM Publish that results in an SAML authentication request to the IDP.
1. AEM Publish generates the SAML request to send to the IDP.
1. AEM Publish signs the SAML request using AEM's private key.
1. AEM Publish initiates the AuthnRequest, an HTTP client-side redirect to the IDP that contains the signed SAML request.
1. IDP receives the AuthnRequest, and validates the signature using AEM's public key, guaranteeing AEM Publish initiated the AuthnRequest.
1. AEM Publish then validates the decrypted SAML assertion's integrity and authenticity using the IDP public certificate.

+++

+++ Understand the SAML assertion encryption flow (optional)

All HTTP communication between IDP and AEM Publish should be over HTTPS, and thus secure by default. However, as required, SAML assertions can be encrypted in the event extra confidentiality is required on top of that provided by HTTPS. To do this, the IDP encrypts the SAML Assertion data using the private key, and AEM Publish decrypts the SAML assertion using the private key.

![SAML 2.0 - SP SAML Assertion encryption](./assets/saml-2-0/sp-samlrequest-encryption-diagram.png)

1. User authenticates to IDP.
1. IDP generates a SAML assertion containing the user's data, and signs it using the IDP's private certificate.
1. IDP then encrypts the SAML assertion with AEM's public key, which requires the AEM private key to decrypt.
1. The encrypted SAML assertion is sent, by way of the user's web browser to AEM Publish.
1. AEM Publish receives the SAML assertion, and decrypts it using AEM's private key.
1. IDP prompts user to authenticate.

+++

Both AuthnRequest signing, and SAML assertion encryption are optional, however they are both enabled, using the [SAML 2.0 authentication handler OSGi configuration property `useEncryption`](#saml-20-authenticationsaml-2-0-authentication), meaning both or neither can be used.

![AEM authentication-service key store](./assets/saml-2-0/authentication-service-key-store.png)

1. Obtain the public key, private key (PKCS#8 in DER format), and certificate chain file (this may be the public key) used to sign the AuthnRequest, and encrypt the SAML assertion. The keys are typically provided by the IT organization's security team.

    + A self-signed key pair can be generated using __openssl__:

    ```
    $ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout aem-private.key -out aem-public.crt

    # Provide a password (keep in safe place), and other requested certificate information

    # Convert the keys to AEM's required format 
    $ openssl rsa -in aem-private.key -outform der -out aem-private.der
    $ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform der -nocrypt -in aem-private.der -outform der -out aem-private-pkcs8.der
    ```

1. Upload the public key to the IDP.
    + Using the `openssl` method above, the public key is the `aem-public.crt` file.
1. Log in to AEM Author as an AEM Administrator, to upload the private key.
1. Navigate to __Tools > Security > Trust Store__, and select __authentication-service__ user, and select __Properties__ from the top action bar.
1. Navigate to __Tools > Security > Users__, and select __authentication-service__ user, and select __Properties__ from the top action bar.
1. Select the __Keystore__ tab.
1. Create or open the keystore. If creating a keystore, keep the password safe.
1. Select __Add private key from DER file__, and add the private key and chain file to AEM:
    + __Alias__: Provide a meaningful name, often the name of the IDP.
    + __Private key file__: Upload the private key file (PKCS#8 in DER format).
        + Using the `openssl` method above, this is the `aem-private-pkcs8.der` file
    + __Select certificate chain file__: Upload the accompanying chain file (this may be the public key).
        + Using the `openssl` method above, this is the `aem-public.crt` file
    + Select __Submit__
1. The newly added certificate appears above the __Add certificate from CRT file__ section.
    + Make note of the __alias__ as this is used in the [SAML 2.0 authentication handler OSGi configuration](#saml-20-authentication-handler-osgi-configuration) 
1. Select __Save & Close__.
1. Create a package containing the updated __authentication-service__ user. 

    _Use the following temporary workaround using packages:_

   1. Navigate to __Tools > Deployment > Packages__.
   1. Create a package
       + Package name: `Authentication Service`
       + Version: `1.0.0`
       + Group: `com.your.company`
   1. Edit the new __Authentication Service Key Store__ package.
   1. Select the __Filters__ tab, and add a filter for the root path `/home/users/system/cq:services/internal/security/<AUTHENTICATION SERVICE UUID>/keystore`.
        + The `<AUTHENTICATION SERVICE UUID>` can be found by navigating to __Tools > Security > Users__, and selecting __authentication-service__ user. The UUID is the last part of the URL.
   1. Select __Done__ and then __Save__.
   1. Select the __Build__ button for the __Authentication Service Key Store__ package.
   1. Once built, select __More__ > __Replicate__ to activate the Authentication Service key store to AEM Publish.

## Configure SAML 2.0 authentication handler{#configure-saml-2-0-authentication-handler}

AEM's SAML configuration is performed via the __Adobe Granite SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler__ OSGi configuration. 
The configuration is an OSGi factory configuration, meaning a single AEM as a Cloud Service Publish service may have multiple SAML configuration's covering discrete resources trees of the repository; this is useful for multi-site AEM deployments.

### AEM user attributes{#aem-user-attributes}

AEM uses the following user attributes, which can be populated via the `synchronizeAttributes` property in the Adobe Granite SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler OSGi configuration.  Any IDP attributes can be synchronized to any AEM user property, however mapping to AEM use attribute properties (listed below) allows AEM to naturally use them.

| User attribute                 | Relative property path from `rep:User` node |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Title (for example, `Mrs`)             | `profile/title`          |
| Given name (i.e. first name)   | `profile/givenName`      |
| Family name (i.e. last name)   | `profile/familyName`     |
| Job title                      | `profile/jobTitle`       |
| Email address                  | `profile/email`          |
| Street address                 | `profile/street`         |
| City                           | `profile/city`           |
| Postal code                    | `profile/postalCode`     |
| Country                        | `profile/country`        |
| Phone number                   | `profile/phoneNumber`    |

1. Create an OSGi configuration file in your project at `/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/wknd-examples/osgiconfig/config.publish/com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.SamlAuthenticationHandler~saml.cfg.json` and open in your IDE.
    + Change `/wknd-examples/` to your `/<project name>/`
    + The identifier after the `~` in the filename should uniquely identify this configuration, so it may be the name of the IDP, such as `...~okta.cfg.json`. The value should be alphanumeric with hyphens.
1.  Paste the following JSON into the `com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.SamlAuthenticationHandler~...cfg.json` file, and update the `wknd` references as needed.

    ```json
    {
        "path": [ "/content/wknd", "/content/dam/wknd" ], 
        "idpCertAlias": "$[env:SAML_IDP_CERT_ALIAS;default=certalias___1652125559800]",
        "idpIdentifier": "$[env:SAML_IDP_ID;default=http://www.okta.com/exk4z55r44Jz9C6am5d7]",
        "idpUrl": "$[env:SAML_IDP_URL;default=https://dev-5511372.okta.com/app/dev-5511372_aemasacloudservice_1/exk4z55r44Jz9C6am5d7/sso/saml]",
        "serviceProviderEntityId": "$[env:SAML_AEM_ID;default=https://publish-p123-e456.adobeaemcloud.com]",
        "useEncryption": false,
        "createUser": true,
        "userIntermediatePath": "wknd/idp",
        "synchronizeAttributes":[
            "firstName=profile/givenName"
        ],
        "addGroupMemberships": true,
        "defaultGroups": [ 
            "wknd-users"
        ]
    }
    ```

1. Update the values as required by your project. See the __SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler OSGi configuration glossary__ above for configuration property descriptions
1. It is recommended, but not required, to use OSGi environment variables and secrets, when values may change out of sync with the release cycle, or when the values different between similar environment types/service tiers. Default values can be set using the `$[env:..;default=the-default-value]"` syntax as shown above.

OSGi configurations per environment (`config.publish.dev`, `config.publish.stage`, and `config.publish.prod`) can be defined with specific attributes if the SAML configuration varies between environments.

### Use encryption

When [encrypting the AuthnRequest and SAML assertion](#encrypting-the-authnrequest-and-saml-assertion), the following properties are required: `useEncryption`, `spPrivateKeyAlias`, and `keyStorePassword`. The `keyStorePassword` contains a password therefore the value must not be stored in the OSGi configuration file, but rather injected using [secret configuration values](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html#secret-configuration-values) 

+++Optionally, update the OSGi configuration to use encryption

1. Open `/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/wknd-examples/osgiconfig/config.publish/com.adobe.granite.auth.saml.SamlAuthenticationHandler~saml.cfg.json` in your IDE.
1. Add the three properties `useEncryption`, `spPrivateKeyAlias`, and `keyStorePassword` as shown below.

    ```json
    {
    "path": [ "/content/wknd", "/content/dam/wknd" ], 
    "idpCertAlias": "$[env:SAML_IDP_CERT_ALIAS;default=certalias___1234567890]",
    "idpIdentifier": "$[env:SAML_IDP_ID;default=http://www.okta.com/abcdef1235678]",
    "idpUrl": "$[env:SAML_IDP_URL;default=https://dev-5511372.okta.com/app/dev-123567890_aemasacloudservice_1/abcdef1235678/sso/saml]",
    "serviceProviderEntityId": "$[env:SAML_AEM_ID;default=https://publish-p123-e456.adobeaemcloud.com]",
    "useEncryption": true,
    "spPrivateKeyAlias": "$[env:SAML_AEM_KEYSTORE_ALIAS;default=aem-saml-encryption]",
    "keyStorePassword": "$[secret:SAML_AEM_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD]",
    "createUser": true,
    "userIntermediatePath": "wknd/idp"
    "synchronizeAttributes":[
        "firstName=profile/givenName"
    ],
    "addGroupMemberships": true,
    "defaultGroups": [ 
        "wknd-users"
    ]
    }
    ```

1. The three OSGi configuration properties required for encryption are:

+ `useEncryption` set to `true`
+ `spPrivateKeyAlias` contains the keystore entry alias for the private key used by the SAML integration.
+ `keyStorePassword` contains an [OSGi secret configuration variable](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/configuring-osgi.html#secret-configuration-values) containing the `authentication-service` user keystore's password.

## Configure Referrer filter

During the SAML authentication process, the IDP initiates a client-side HTTP POST to AEM Publish's `.../saml_login` end point. If the IDP and AEM Publish exist on different origin, AEM Publish's __Referrer Filter__ is configured via OSGi configuration to allow HTTP POSTs from the IDP's origin.

1. Create (or edit) an OSGi configuration file in your project at `/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/wknd-examples/osgiconfig/config.publish/org.apache.sling.security.impl.ReferrerFilter.cfg.json`.
    + Change `/wknd-examples/` to your `/<project name>/`
1. Ensure the `allow.empty` value is set to `true`, the `allow.hosts` (or if you prefer, `allow.hosts.regexp`) contains the IDP's origin, and `filter.methods` includes `POST`. The OSGi configuration should be similar to:

    ```json
    {
        "allow.empty": true,
        "allow.hosts.regexp": [ ],
        "allow.hosts": [ 
            "$[env:SAML_IDP_REFERRER;default=dev-123567890.okta.com]"
        ],
        "filter.methods": [
            "POST",
        ],
        "exclude.agents.regexp": [ ]
    }
    ```

AEM Publish supports a single Referrer filter configuration, so merge the SAML configuration requirements, with any existing configurations.

OSGi configurations per environment (`config.publish.dev`, `config.publish.stage`, and `config.publish.prod`) can be defined with specific attributes if the `allow.hosts` (or `allow.hosts.regex`) vary between environments.

## Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

During the SAML authentication process, the IDP initiates a client-side HTTP POST to AEM Publish's `.../saml_login` end point. If the IDP and AEM Publish exist on different hosts/domains, AEM Publish's __CRoss-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)__ must be configured to allow HTTP POSTs from the IDP's host/domain.

This HTTP POST request's `Origin` header usually has a different value than the AEM Publish host, thus requiring CORS configuration. 

When testing SAML authentication on the local AEM SDK (`localhost:4503`), the IDP may set the `Origin` header to `null`. If so, add `"null"` to the `alloworigin` list.

1. Create an OSGi configuration file in your project at `/ui.config/src/main/content/jcr_root/wknd-examples/osgiconfig/config.publish/com.adobe.granite.cors.impl.CORSPolicyImpl~saml.cfg.json`
    + Change `/wknd-examples/` to your project name
    + The identifier after the `~` in the filename should uniquely identify this configuration, so it may be the name of the IDP, such as `...CORSPolicyImpl~okta.cfg.json`. The value should be alphanumeric with hyphens.
1.  Paste the following JSON into the `com.adobe.granite.cors.impl.CORSPolicyImpl~...cfg.json` file.

```json
{
    "alloworigin": [ 
        "$[env:SAML_IDP_ORIGIN;default=https://dev-1234567890.okta.com]", 
        "null"
    ],
    "allowedpaths": [ 
        ".*/saml_login"
    ],
    "supportedmethods": [ 
        "POST"
    ]
}
```

OSGi configurations per environment (`config.publish.dev`, `config.publish.stage`, and `config.publish.prod`) can be defined with specific attributes if the `alloworigin` and `allowedpaths` varies between environments.

## Configure AEM Dispatcher to allow SAML HTTP POSTs

After successful authentication to the IDP, the IDP will orchestrate an HTTP POST back to AEM's registered `/saml_login` end point (configured in the IDP). This HTTP POST to `/saml_login` is blocked by default at Dispatcher, so it must be explicitly allowed using the following Dispatcher rule:

1. Open `dispatcher/src/conf.dispatcher.d/filters/filters.any` in your IDE.
1. Add to the bottom of the file, an allow rule for HTTP POSTs to URLs that end with `/saml_login`.

```
...

# Allow SAML HTTP POST to ../saml_login end points
/0190 { /type "allow" /method "POST" /url "*/saml_login" }
```

If URL rewriting at the Apache webserver is configured (`dispatcher/src/conf.d/rewrites/rewrite.rules`), ensure that requests to the `.../saml_login` end points are not accidentally mangled.

## Deploying SAML configuration

The OSGi configurations must be committed to Git and deployed to AEM as a Cloud Service using Cloud Manager.

```
$ git remote -v            
adobe   https://git.cloudmanager.adobe.com/myOrg/myCloudManagerGit/ (fetch)
adobe   https://git.cloudmanager.adobe.com/myOrg/myCloudManagerGit/ (push)
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "SAML 2.0 configurations"
$ git push adobe saml-auth:develop
```

Deploy the target Cloud Manager Git branch (in this example, `develop`), using a Full Stack deployment pipeline.

## Invoking the SAML authentication

The SAML authentication flow can be invoked from an AEM Site web page, by creating a specially crafted links, or a buttons. The parameters described below can be programmatically set as needed, so for instance, a log in button may set the `saml_request_path`, which is where the user is taken upon successful SAML authentication, to different AEM pages, based on the context of the button.

### GET request

SAML authentication can be invoked by creating a HTTP GET request in the format:

`HTTP GET /system/sling/login`

and providing query parameters:

| Query parameter name | Query parameter value |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| `resource`           | Any JCR path, or sub-path, that is the SAML authentication handler listens on, as defined in the [Adobe Granite SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler OSGi configuration's](#configure-saml-2-0-authentication-handler) `path` property. |
| `saml_request_path`  | The URL path the user should be taken to after successful SAML authentication.   |

For example, this HTML link will trigger the SAML log in flow, and upon success take the user to `/content/wknd/us/en/protected/page.html`. These query parameters can be programmaticaly set as needed.

```html
<a href="/system/sling/login?resource=/content/wknd&saml_request_path=/content/wknd/us/en/protected/page.html">
    Log in using SAML
</a>
```

## POST request

SAML authentication can be invoked by creating a HTTP POST request in the format:

`HTTP POST /system/sling/login`

and providing the form data:

| Form data name | Form data value |
|----------------------|-----------------------|
| `resource`           | Any JCR path, or sub-path, that is the SAML authentication handler listens on, as defined in the [Adobe Granite SAML 2.0 Authentication Handler OSGi configuration's](#configure-saml-2-0-authentication-handler) `path` property. |
| `saml_request_path`  | The URL path the user should be taken to after successful SAML authentication.   |


For example, this HTML button will use a HTTP POST to trigger the SAML log in flow, and upon success, take the user to `/content/wknd/us/en/protected/page.html`. These form data parameters can be programmaticaly set as needed.

```html
<form action="/system/sling/login" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="resource" value="/content/wknd">
    <input type="hidden" name="saml_request_path" value="/content/wknd/us/en/protected/page.html">
    <input type="submit" value="Log in using SAML">
</form>
```

### Dispatcher configuration

Both the HTTP GET and POST methods require client access to AEM's `/system/sling/login` endpoints, and thus they must be allowed via AEM Dispatcher.

Allow the necessary URL patterns based on if GET or POST isused

```
# Allow GET-based SAML authentication invocation
/0191 { /type "allow" /method "GET" /url "/system/sling/login" /query="*" }

# Allow POST-based SAML authentication invocation
/0192 { /type "allow" /method "POST" /url "/system/sling/login" }
```
