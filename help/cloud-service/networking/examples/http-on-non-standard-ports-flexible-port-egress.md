# HTTP/HTTPS connections on non-standard ports for flexible port egress

HTTP/HTTPS connections on non-standard ports (not 80/443) must be proxied out of AEM as a Cloud Service, however they do not need any special `portForwards` rules, and can use AEM's advanced networking's `AEM_PROXY_HOST` and a reserved proxy port `AEM_HTTP_PROXY_PORT` or `AEM_HTTPS_PROXY_PORT` depending on is the destination is HTTP/HTTPS.

## Advanced networking support

The following code example is supported by the following advanced networking options.

Ensure the the [appropriate](../advanced-networking.md#advanced-networking) advanced networking configuration has been set up prior to following this tutorial.

| No advanced networking | [Flexible port egress](../flexible-port-egress.md) | [Dedicated egress IP address](../dedicated-egress-ip-address.md) | [Virtual Private Network](../vpn.md) |
|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:---------:|
| &#10008; | &#10004; | &#10008; | &#10008; |

>[!CAUTION]
>
> This code example is only for [Flexible Port Egress](../flexible-port-egress.md). A similar, but different code example is available for [HTTP/HTTPS connections on non-standard ports for Dedicated Egress IP address and VPN](./http-dedicated-egress-ip-vpn.md).

## Code example

This Java&trade; code example is of an OSGi service that can run in AEM as a Cloud Service that makes an HTTP connection to an external web server on 8080. Connections to HTTPS web servers use the environment variables `AEM_PROXY_HOST` and `AEM_HTTPS_PROXY_PORT` (default to `proxy.tunnel:3128` in AEM releases < 6094).

>[!NOTE]
> It is recommended the [Java&trade; 11 HTTP APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/package-summary.html) are used to make HTTP/HTTPS calls from AEM.
