A critical part of onboarding is to create AEM as a Cloud Service programs and provision various environments using Adobe Cloud Manager. The [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) is used to assign roles and provide access for users in your organization to AEM environments.

## Key Activities

+ A system administrator uses the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) to assign one or more users to the [Cloud Manager - Business Owner](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/requirements/setting-up-users-and-roles.html) product profile.
+ User(s) assigned to the Business Owner Product Profile use the self-service features of [Cloud Manager](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/introduction-to-cloud-manager.html) to [create program(s)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/production-programs/creating-production-program.html) and [add environments](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/manage-environments.html)
+ Use the [Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) to assign Developers and users to different [Cloud Manager roles](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/requirements/setting-up-users-and-roles.html) and grant permission to various AEM environments.
