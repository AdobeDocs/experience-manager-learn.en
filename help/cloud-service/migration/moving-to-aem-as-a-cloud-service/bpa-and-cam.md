# Best Practices Analyzer and Cloud Acceleration Manager

Learn how Best Practices Analyzer (BPA) and Cloud Acceleration Manager (CAM) provides a customized guide for migrating to AEM as a Cloud Service.Â 

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/336957?quality=12&learn=on)

## Using BPA and CAM 

![BPA and CAM high level diagram](assets/bpa-cam-diagram.png)

The BPA package should be installed on a clone of the production AEM 6.x environment. The BPA will generate a report that can then be uploaded into CAM, which will provide guidance into the key activities that need to take place in order to move to AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Key activities

+ Make a clone of your production 6.x environment. As you migrate content and refactor code, having a clone of a production environment is valuable to test various tools and changes.
+ Download the latest BPA tool from the [Software Distribution Portal](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/aemcloud.html) and install on your AEM 6.x cloned environment.
+ Use the BPA tool to generate a report that can be uploaded to Cloud Acceleration Manager (CAM). CAM is accessed through [https://experience.adobe.com/](https://experience.adobe.com/) > **Experience Manager** > **Cloud Acceleration Manager**. 
+ Use CAM to provide guidance on what updates need to be made to the current code base and environment in order to move to AEM as a Cloud Service.
