title: Using Adobe Cloud Manager - CI/CD Non-Production Pipeline
description: CI/CD Non-production pipelines are broken into two categories, Code Quality pipelines, and Deployment pipelines. Code Quality pipelines all code from a Git branch to build and be evaluated against Cloud Manager's code quality scan. Deployment pipelines support the automated deployment of code from the Git repository to any Non-production environment, meaning any provisioned AEM environment that is not Stage or Production.
