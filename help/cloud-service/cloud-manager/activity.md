# Using Adobe Cloud Manager - Activity

Cloud Manager provides a consolidated view into a Program's activity, listing all CI/CD Pipeline executions, both production and non-production. This allows users to view any pipelines currently in progress and review previous deployments.

Cloud Manager also integrates at a per-user level with [Adobe Experience Cloud Notifications](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-manager/using/how-to-use/notifications.html), providing a omnipresent view into events and actions of interest.
