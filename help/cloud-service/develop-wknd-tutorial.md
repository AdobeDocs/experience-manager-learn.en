The video shows how the WKND Site project can be:

1. Sourced from a 3rd party Git repository, in this case Github.com, but could be any Git repository
2. Pushed to an upstream Adobe Cloud Manager Git repository registered with an AEM as a Cloud Service Program
3. Deployed via Cloud Manager pipelines to AEM as a Cloud Service environments
