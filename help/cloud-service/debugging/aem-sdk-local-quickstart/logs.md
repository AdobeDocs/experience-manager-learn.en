# Debugging AEM SDK using logs 

Accessing the AEM SDK's logs, either the AEM SDK local quickstart Jar's or Dispatcher Tools' can provide key insights into debugging AEM applications.

## AEM Logs

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/34334/?quality=12&learn=on)

Logs act as the frontline for debugging AEM applications, but are dependent on adequate logging in the deployed AEM application. Adobe recommends keeping local development and AEM as a Cloud Service Dev logging configurations as similar a possible, as it normalizes log visibility on the AEM SDK’s local quickstart and AEM as a Cloud Service's Dev environments, reducing configuration twiddling and re-deployment.

The [AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype) configures logging at the DEBUG level for your AEM application's Java packages for local development via the Sling Logger OSGi configuration found at

 `ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/example/config/org.apache.sling.commons.log.LogManager.factory.config-example.cfg.json`
 
 which logs to the `error.log`.

If default logging is insufficient for local development, ad hoc logging can be configured via AEM SDK’s local quickstart's Log Support web console, at ([/system/console/slinglog](http://localhost:4502/system/console/slinglog)), however it's not recommended ad hoc changes are persisted to Git unless these same log configurations are needed on AEM as a Cloud Service Dev environments as well. Keep in mind, changes via the Log Support console, are persisted directly to the  AEM SDK’s local quickstart's repository.

Java log statements can be view in the `error.log` file:

```
$ ~/aem-sdk/author/crx-quickstart/logs/error.log
```

Often it it useful to "tail" the `error.log` which streams its output to the terminal.

+ macOS/Linux
    + `$ tail -f ~/aem-sdk/author/crx-quickstart/logs/error.log`
+ Windows requires [3rd party tail applications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/187587/a-windows-equivalent-of-the-unix-tail-command) or the use of [Powershell's Get-Content command](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46444596/133936).

## Dispatcher logs

Dispatcher logs are output to stdout when `bin/docker_run` is invoked, however logs can be directly access with in the Docker contain.

### Accessing logs in the Docker container{#dispatcher-tools-access-logs}

Dispatcher logs can be directly accessing in the Docker container at `/etc/httpd/logs`.

```shell
$ docker ps

# locate the CONTAINER ID associated with "adobe/aem-ethos/dispatcher-publisher" IMAGE
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
46127c9d7081        adobe/aem-ethos/dispatcher-publish:2.0.23   "/docker_entrypoint.…"   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   wonderful_merkle

$ docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/sh

/ # 
/ # cd /etc/httpd/logs
/ # ls
    dispatcher.log          healthcheck_access_log  httpd_access.log        httpd_error.log

# When finished viewing the logs files, exit the Docker container's shell
/# exit
```

_The `<CONTAINER ID>` in `docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> /bin/sh` must be replaced with the target Docker CONTAINER ID listed from the `docker ps` command._


### Copying the Docker logs to the local filesystem{#dispatcher-tools-copy-logs}

Dispatcher logs can be copied out of the Docker container at `/etc/httpd/logs` to the local file system for inspection using your favorite log analysis tool. Note that this is a point-in-time copy, and does not provide real time updates to the logs.

```shell
$ docker ps

# locate the CONTAINER ID associated with "adobe/aem-ethos/dispatcher-publisher" IMAGE
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                       COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES
46127c9d7081        adobe/aem-ethos/dispatcher-publish:2.0.23   "/docker_entrypoint.…"   6 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:8080->80/tcp   wonderful_merkle

$ docker cp -L <CONTAINER ID>:/etc/httpd/logs logs 
$ cd logs
$ ls
    dispatcher.log          healthcheck_access_log  httpd_access.log        httpd_error.log
```

_The `<CONTAINER_ID>` in `docker cp <CONTAINER_ID>:/var/log/apache2 ./` must be replaced with the target Docker CONTAINER ID listed from the `docker ps` command._
