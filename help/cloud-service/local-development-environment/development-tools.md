# Set up development tools

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) development requires a minimal set of development tooling to be installed and set up on the developer machine. These tools support the development and building of AEM Projects.

Note that `~` is used as shorthand for the User's Directory. In Windows, this is the equivalent of `%HOMEPATH%`.

## Install Java

Experience Manager is a Java application, and thus requires the Java SDK to support the development and the AEM as a Cloud Service SDK.

1. [Download and install the latest release Java 11 SDK](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/general.html?1_group.propertyvalues.property=.%2Fjcr%3Acontent%2Fmetadata%2Fdc%3AsoftwareType&1_group.propertyvalues.operation=equals&1_group.propertyvalues.0_values=software-type%3Atooling&fulltext=Oracle%7E+JDK%7E+11%7E&orderby=%40jcr%3Acontent%2Fjcr%3AlastModified&orderby.sort=desc&layout=list&p.offset=0&p.limit=14)
1. Verify Java 11 SDK is installed by running the command:
    + Windows: `java -version`
    + macOS / Linux: `java --version`

## Install Homebrew

_The use of Homebrew is optional, but recommended._

Homebrew is a open-source package manager for macOS, Windows and Linux. All the supporting tools can be installed separately, Homebrew provides a convenient way to install and update a variety of development tools required for Experience Manager development.

1. Open your Terminal
1. Check if Homebrew is already installed by running the command: `brew --version`.
1. If Homebrew is not installed, install Homebrew
    + [Install Homebrew on macOS](https://brew.sh/)
        + Homebrew on macOS requires [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) or [Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/), install-able via the command:
            + `xcode-select --install`
    + [Install Homebrew on Linux](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#linux-or-windows-10-subsystem-for-linux)
    + [Install Homebrew on Windows 10](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#linux-or-windows-10-subsystem-for-linux)
1. Verify Homebrew is installed by running the command: `brew --version`

>[!TIP]
>
>[AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype)-based AEM Projects install an isolated version of Node.js at build time. It is good to keep the local development system's version in sync (or close to) the Node.js and npm versions specified in your AEM Maven project's Reactor pom.xml.
>
>See this example [AEM Project Reactor pom.xml](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd/blob/9ac94f3f40c978a53ec88fae79fbc17dd2db72f2/pom.xml#L117-L118) for where to locate the Node.js and npm build versions.

## Install Maven

Apache Maven is the open-source Java command-line tool used to build AEM Projects generated from the AEM Project Maven Archetype. All major IDE's ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/), etc.) have integrated Maven support.

+ Install Maven using Homebrew
    1. Open your Terminal/Command Prompt
    1. Execute the command: `brew install maven`

## Set up Adobe I/O CLI{#aio-cli}

The [Adobe I/O CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli), or `aio`, provides command line access to a variety of Adobe services, including [Cloud Manager](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager) and [Asset Compute](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-asset-compute). The Adobe I/O CLI plays an integral role in development on AEM as a Cloud Service as it provides developers the ability to:
    
+ Tail logs from AEM as a Cloud Services services
+ Manage Cloud Manager pipelines form the CLI

### Install the Adobe I/O CLI

1. Ensure [Node.js is installed](#node-js) as the Adobe I/O CLI is an npm module
    + Run `node --version` to confirm
1. Execute `npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli` to install the `aio` npm module globally

### Set up the Adobe I/O CLI Cloud Manager plugin{#aio-cloud-manager}

The Adobe I/O Cloud Manager plugin allows the aio CLI to interact with Adobe Cloud Manager via the `aio cloudmanager` command.

1. Execute `aio plugins:install @adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager` to install the [aio Cloud Manager plug-in](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager).

### Set up the Adobe I/O CLI Asset Compute plugin{#aio-asset-compute}

The Adobe I/O Cloud Manager plugin allows the aio CLI to generate and run Asset Compute workers via the `aio asset-compute` command.

1. Execute `aio plugins:install @adobe/aio-cli-plugin-asset-compute` to install the [aio Asset Compute plug-in](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-asset-compute).

### Set up the Adobe I/O CLI authentication

In order for the Adobe I/O CLI to communicate with Cloud Manager, a Cloud Manager integration must be created in Adobe I/O Console, and credentials must be obtained to successfully authenticate.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/35094?quality=12&learn=on)

1. Log in to [console.adobe.io](https://console.adobe.io)
1. Ensure your Organization that includes the Cloud Manager product to connect to is active in the Adobe Org switcher
1. Create a new or open an existing [Adobe I/O program](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/console/docs.html#!AdobeDocs/adobeio-console/master/projects.md)
    + Adobe I/O Console programs are simply organizational groupings of integrations, create or use and existing program based on how you want to manage your integrations
    + If creating a new project, select "Empty Project" if prompted (vs. Create from Template)
    + Adobe I/O Console programs are different concepts to Cloud Manager programs
1. Create a new Cloud Manager API integration with the "Developer - Cloud Service" profile
1. Obtain the Service Account (JWT) credentials needs to populate Adobe I/O CLI's [config.json](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager#authentication)
1. Load the `config.json` file into the Adobe I/O CLI
    + `$ aio config:set jwt-auth PATH_TO_CONFIG_JSON_FILE --file --json`
1. Load the `private.key` file into the Adobe I/O CLI
    + `$ aio config:set jwt-auth.jwt_private_key PATH_TO_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE --file`

Begin [executing commands](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli-plugin-cloudmanager#commands) for Cloud Manager via the Adobe I/O CLI.

## Set up the development IDE

AEM development primarily consists of Java and Front-end (JavaScript, CSS, etc) development and XML management. The following are the most popular IDEs for AEM development.

### IntelliJ IDEA

__[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)__ is a powerful IDE for Java development. IntelliJ IDEA comes in two flavors, a free Community edition and a commercial (paid) Ultimate version. The free Community version is sufficient for AEM development, however the Ultimate [expands its capability set](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/26089/?quality=12&learn=on)

+ [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
+ [Download the Repo tool](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/tools/tree/master/repo#installation)

### Microsoft Visual Studio Code

__[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__ (VS Code) is a free, open-source tool for front-end developers. Visual Studio Code can be set up to integrate content sync with AEM with the help of an Adobe tool, __[repo](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/tools/tree/master/repo#integration-into-visual-studio-code)__.

Visual Studio Code is the ideal choice for front-end developers primarily creating front-end code; JavaScript, CSS and HTML. While VS Code has Java support via [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial), it may lack some of the advanced features provided by more Java-specific.
