# How to use Rapid Development Environment

Learn **how to use** Rapid Development Environment (RDE) in AEM as a Cloud Service. Deploy code and content for faster development cycles of your near-final code to the RDE, from your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Using [AEM WKND Sites Project](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd#aem-wknd-sites-project) you learn how to deploy various AEM artifacts to the RDE by running AEM-RDE's `install` command from your favorite IDE.

- AEM code & content package (all, ui.apps) deployment
- OSGi bundle and config file deployment
- Apache and Dispatcher configs deployment as a zip file
- Individual files like HTL, `.content.xml` (dialog XML) deployment
- Review other RDE commands like `status, reset and delete`
