# Export Content Fragment to XML

![Content Fragment Editor header menu extension example](./assets/export-to-xml/hero.png){align="center"}

Custom buttons can be added to the Content Fragment Editor header menu using the `headerMenu` extension point. This example shows how to add a button to the header menu and how to handle the click event to export the active Content Fragment as XML or CSV.

Header buttons can exist as a single button, or as a button with subitems. This example shows how to implement a button with subitems, however includes the commented out code to implement a single button. 

## Extension point

This example extends to extension point `headerBar` to add custom button to the Content Fragment Editor.

| AEM UI extended | Extension point |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | 
| [Content Fragment Editor](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/services/aem-cf-editor/) | [Header Menu](https://developer.adobe.com/uix/docs/services/aem-cf-editor/api/header-menu/) | 

## Example extension

The following example creates a header menu button with two subitems, one to export the active Content Fragment as XML (implemented), and one to export the active Content Fragment as CSV (not implemented).

The code shows how the Content Fragment's content can be obtained in the extension's registration file, and how the Content Fragment's JSON content can be transformed can be exported.

### Extension registration

`ExtensionRegistration.js`, mapped to the index.html route, is the entry point for the AEM extension and defines:

+ The location of the extension button appears (`headerMenu`) in the AEM authoring experience
+ The extension button's definition in getButton() function
+ The click handler for the button, in the onClick() function, or a list of subitems, and their click handlers.

#### Content Fragment data

The active Content Fragment can be retrieved using the `getContentFragment()` method on the `guestConnection.host.contentFragment` object.

```javascript
const contentFragment = await guestConnection.host.contentFragment.getContentFragment();
```

The `contentFragment` object contains all the information about the Content Fragment, including the path, model, metadata, main content, and any variants.
