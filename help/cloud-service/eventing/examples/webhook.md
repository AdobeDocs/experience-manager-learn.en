# Webhooks and AEM Events

Learn how to receive AEM events on a webhook and review the event details such as payload, headers, and metadata.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/3427051?quality=12&learn=on)

In this example, utilizing an Adobe-provided _hosted webhook_ allows you to receive AEM events without the need to set up your own webhook. This Adobe-provided webhook is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), a platform known for offering a web-based environment conducive to building and deploying web applications. However, the option to use your own webhook is also available if preferred.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need:

- AEM as a Cloud Service environment with [AEM Eventing enabled](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-cloud/experience-manager-apis/guides/events/#enable-aem-events-on-your-aem-cloud-service-environment).

- [Adobe Developer Console project configured for AEM Events](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-cloud/experience-manager-apis/guides/events/#how-to-subscribe-to-aem-events-in-the-adobe-developer-console).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>AEM as a Cloud Service Eventing is only available to registered users in pre-release mode. To enable AEM eventing on your AEM as a Cloud Service environment, contact [AEM-Eventing team](mailto:grp-aem-events@adobe.com).

## Access webhook

To access the Adobe-provided webhook, follow these steps:

- Verify you can access the [Glitch - hosted webhook](https://lovely-ancient-coaster.glitch.me/) in a new browser tab.

    ![Glitch - hosted webhook](../assets/examples/webhook/glitch-hosted-webhook.png)

- Enter a unique name for your webhook, for example `<YOUR_PETS_NAME>-aem-eventing` and click **Connect**. You should see `Connected to: ${YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL}` message appearing on the screen.

    ![Glitch - create webhook](../assets/examples/webhook/glitch-create-webhook.png)

- Make a note of the **Webhook URL**. You need it later in this tutorial.

## Configure webhook in Adobe Developer Console Project

To receive AEM Events on the above webhook URL, follow these steps:

- In the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com), navigate to your project and click to open it.

- Under **Products & services** section, click ellipses `...` next to the desired events card that should send AEM events to the webhook and select **Edit**.

    ![Adobe Developer Console Project Edit](../assets/examples/webhook/adobe-developer-console-project-edit.png)

- In the newly opened **Configure event registration** dialog, click **Next** to proceed to **How to receive events** step.

    ![Adobe Developer Console Project Configure](../assets/examples/webhook/adobe-developer-console-project-configure.png)

- In the **How to receive events** step, select **Webhook** option and paste the **Webhook URL** you copied earlier from the Glitch hosted webhook and click **Save configured events**.

    ![Adobe Developer Console Project Webhook](../assets/examples/webhook/adobe-developer-console-project-webhook.png)

- In the Glitch webook page, you should see a GET request, it is a challenge request sent by the Adobe I/O Events to verify the webhook URL.

## Trigger AEM events

To trigger AEM events from your AEM as a Cloud Service environment that has been registered in the above Adobe Developer Console project follow these steps:

- Access and login to your AEM as a Cloud Service author environment via [Cloud Manager](https://my.cloudmanager.adobe.com/).

- Depending on your **Subscribed Events**, create, update, delete, publish or unpublish a Content Fragment.

## Review event details

After completing the above steps, you should see the AEM Events being delivered to the webhook. Look for the POST request in the Glitch webhook page. 

![Glitch - POST request](../assets/examples/webhook/glitch-post-request.png)

Here are key details of the POST request:

- path: `/webhook/${YOUR-WEBHOOK-URL}`, for example `/webhook/AdobeTM-aem-eventing`

- headers: request headers sent by the Adobe I/O Events, for example:

- body/payload: request body sent by the Adobe I/O Events, for example:

    "properties": [

        "name": "groupSize",
        "changeType": "modified"
      }
    ]
  },
  "event_id": "a0f3fb7d-b02c-4612-aac6-e472b80af793",
  "recipient_client_id": "f51ea733ba404db299fefbf285dc1c42"
}
```

You can see that the AEM event details have all the necessary information to process the event in the webhook. For example, the event type (`type`), event source (`source`), event id (`event_id`), event time (`time`), and event data (`data`).
