# Set up development environment

If you already have set up the development environment, you can safely skip this part of the tutorial.

[Create Maven project](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/forms/developing-for-cloud-service/getting-started)

[Install IntelliJ](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/forms/developing-for-cloud-service/intellij-set-up) - You can skip adding the fonts module for this tutorial.

[Initialize Git](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/forms/developing-for-cloud-service/setup-git)

[Sync IntelliJ with local cloud ready instance of AEM Forms](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/forms/developing-for-cloud-service/intellij-and-aem-sync)
