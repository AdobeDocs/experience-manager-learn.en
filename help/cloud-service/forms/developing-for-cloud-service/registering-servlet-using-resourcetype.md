# Introduction

Binding servlets by paths has several disadvantages when compared to binding by resource types, namely:

* Path-bound servlets cannot be access controlled using the default JCR repository ACLs
* Path-bound servlets can only be registered to a path and not a resource type (i.e. no suffix handling)
* If a path-bound servlet is not active, e.g. if the bundle is missing or not started, a POST might result in unexpected results. usually creating a node at `/bin/xyz` which subsequently overlays the servlets path binding
the mapping is not transparent to a developer looking just at the repository
Given these drawbacks it is strongly recommended to bind servlets to resource types rather than paths

## Create Servlet

Launch your aem-banking project in IntelliJ. Create a servlet called GetFieldChoices under the servlets folder as shown in the screen-shot below.
![choices](assets/fetchchoices.png)

## Sample Servlet

The following servlet is bound to the Sling resource type: _**azure/fetchchoices**_



```java
import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest;
import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletResponse;
import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingAllMethodsServlet;
import org.apache.sling.servlets.annotations.SlingServletResourceTypes;
import org.osgi.framework.Constants;
import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;
import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Reference;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import javax.jcr.Session;
import javax.servlet.Servlet;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.Serializable;

@Component(
        service={Servlet.class }
)

        @SlingServletResourceTypes(
                resourceTypes="azure/fetchchoices",
                methods= "GET",
                extensions="json"
                )


public class GetFieldChoices extends SlingAllMethodsServlet implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    private final  transient Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass());


   

    protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response) {

        log.debug("The form path I got was "+request.getParameter("formPath"));

    }
}
```

## Create Resources in CRX

* Login to your local AEM SDK.
* Create a resource named `fetchchoices` (you can name this node anyway you want it) of type `cq:Page` under content node. 
* Save your changes
* Create a node called `jcr:content` of type `cq:PageContent` and save the changes
* Add the following properties to the `jcr:content` node

| Property Name      | Property Value     |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| jcr:title          | Utility Servlets   |
| sling:resourceType | `azure/fetchchoices` |
                                        

The `sling:resourceType` value has to match resourceTypes="azure/fetchchoices specified in the servlet.

You can now invoke your servlet by requesting the resource with `sling:resourceType` = `azure/fetchchoices` at its full path, with any selectors or extensions registered in the Sling servlet.
 
 ```html
 http://localhost:4502/content/fetchchoices/jcr:content.json?formPath=/content/forms/af/forrahul/jcr:content/guideContainer
 ```
 
The path `/content/fetchchoices/jcr:content` is the path of the resource and extension `.json` is what is specified in the servlet

## Sync your AEM Project

1. Open the AEM project in your favorite editor. I have used intelliJ for this.
1. Create a folder called `fetchchoices` under `\aem-banking-application\ui.content\src\main\content\jcr_root\content`
1. Right click `fetchchoices` folder and select `repo | Get Command` (This menu item is setup in a previous chapter of this tutorial).

This should sync this node from AEM to your local AEM project.

Your AEM project structure should look like this
![resource-resolver](assets/mapping-servlet-resource.png)
Update the filter.xml in the aem-banking-application\ui.content\src\main\content\META-INF\vault folder with the following entry

```xml
<filter root="/content/fetchchoices" mode="merge"/>
```

You can now push your changes to an AEM as a Cloud Service environment using Cloud Manager.
