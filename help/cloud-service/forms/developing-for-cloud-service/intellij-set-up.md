# Installing IntelliJ

Install [IntelliJ community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows). You can accept the default settings while suggested during the installation.

## Import the AEM Project

* Launch IntelliJ
* Import the AEM project you created in the earlier step. After project is imported your screen should look something like this ![aem-banking-app](assets/aem-banking-app.png). You will typically work with core,ui.apps,ui.config and ui.content sub projects.
* If you do not see the maven and terminal window, please go to view->Tools Window and select Maven and Terminal
