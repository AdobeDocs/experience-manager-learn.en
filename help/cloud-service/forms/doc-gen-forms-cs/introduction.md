# Introduction

In this course, we will use the document generation microservices to generate a pdf by merging data with a XDP template. To use these microservices from an external application involves the following steps:

1. Generate service credentials for an AEM technical account
1. Create a JSON Web Token (JWT) from the service credentials and exchange the same for an access token
1. Configure access for the technical account in AEM 
1. Make HTTP calls using the access token
