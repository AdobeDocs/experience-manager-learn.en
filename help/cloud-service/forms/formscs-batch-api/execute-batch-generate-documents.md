# Execute Batch Configuration

To run the batch make a POST request to following API

``` xml
<baseURL>/confi/<configName>/execution
```

This API expects an empty json object as a parameter in the request body.
This API returns a unique URL in the response header identified by **location** key.
A GET request to this unique URL will tell you the status of the batch execution

The following video demonstrates the triggering of the batch configuration
