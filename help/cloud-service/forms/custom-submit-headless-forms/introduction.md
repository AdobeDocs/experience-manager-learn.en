# Customize response based on submitted data

After the form is submitted , it is important to provide feedback to the user about the outcome of the submission. The submission response could include an transaction id, or simply a personalized response. To satify this use case, a custom submit service is written in AEM Forms and the headless form is submitted to this custom submit service.

## Pre-requisites

To successfully implement this functionality, the familiarity with the following is recommended

* Experience with Git
* Experience with AEM Cloud Manager
* Maven(this article was tested with 3.8.6)
* Local AEM Forms Cloud ready author instance
* Access to AEM Forms as Cloud Service environment
* IntelliJ or any other IDE


## Next Steps

[Write the custom submit service](./custom-submit-service.md)
