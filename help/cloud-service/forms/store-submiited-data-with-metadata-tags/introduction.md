# Introduction

In this tutorial, you learn how to implement a simple use case of storing form submissions in Azure storage with blob index tags. Blob index tags provide data management and discovery capabilities by using key-value index tag attributes. You can categorize and find objects within a single container or across all containers in your storage account.
