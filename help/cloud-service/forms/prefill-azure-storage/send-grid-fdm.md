# Integrate with SendGrid

AEM Forms Data Integration allows configuring and connecting disparate data sources with AEM Forms. It provides an intuitive user interface to create a unified data representation schema of business entities and services across connected data sources.

We have used SendGrid API to send e-mails using dynamic template. It is assumed that you are familiar with SendGrid API for sending e-mails using dynamic templates. A swagger file to describe to API has been provided to you as part of this tutorial.

## Create the integration

Please follow the following steps to create the integration between AEM Forms and SendGrid

* Create a RESTful data source using the [swagger file](./assets/SendGridWithDynamicTemplate.yaml). [Follow this video for  detailed instructions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/forms/ic-web-channel-tutorial/parttwo.html) on creating data sources in AEM Forms
* Create Form Data Model based on the data source created in the earlier step.[Follow the detailed documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/integrate/use-form-data-model/create-form-data-models.html) on creating Form Data Model.

The form data model created for this tutorial is included as part of the article assets.
