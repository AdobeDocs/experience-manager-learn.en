# Create an Asset Compute project

Asset Compute applications are Node.js projects, generated using the Adobe I/O CLI, that adhere to a certain structure that allow them to be deployed to Adobe I/O Runtime and integrated with AEM as a Cloud Service. A single Asset Compute project can contain one or more Asset Compute workers, with each having a discrete HTTP end-point referenceable from an AEM as a Cloud Service Processing Profile.

## Generate a project

_Click-through of generating an Asset Compute project (No audio)_


Use the [Adobe I/O CLI Asset Compute plugin](../set-up/development-environment.md#aio-cli) to generate a new, empty Asset Compute project.

1. From the command line navigate to the folder to contain the project.
1. From the command line, execute `aio app init` to begin the interactive project generation CLI.
    + This may spawn a Web browser prompting for authentication to Adobe I/O. If it does, provide your Adobe credentials associated with the [required Adobe services and products](../set-up/accounts-and-services.md). If you are unable to log in, please follow these instructions on how to generate a project. 
1. __Select Org__
    + Select the Adobe Org that has AEM as a Cloud Service, Project Firefly are registered to
1. __Select Project__
    + Locate and select the Project. This is the [Project title](../set-up/firefly.md) created from the Firefly project template, in this case `WKND AEM Asset Compute`
1. __Select Workspace__
    +  Select the `Development` workspace
1. __Which Adobe I/O App features do you want to enable for this project? Select components to include__
    + Select `Actions: Deploy runtime actions`
    + Use the arrows keys to select and space to unselect/select, and Enter to confirm selection
1. __Select type of actions to generate__
    + Select `Adobe Asset Compute Worker`
    + Use the arrows keys to select, space to unselect/select, and Enter to confirm selection
1. __How would you like to name this action?__
    + Use the default name `worker`. 
    + If your project contains multiple workers that perform different asset computations, name them semantically

## Review the anatomy of the project

The generated Asset Compute project is a Node.js project for a specialized Adobe Project Firefly application, the following are idiosyncratic to Asset Compute project:

+ `/actions` contains sub-folders, and each sub-folder defines an Asset Compute worker. 
    + `/actions/<worker-name>/index.js` defines the JavaScript executed to perform the work of this worker. 
        + The folder name `worker` is a default, and can be anything, as long as it is registered in the `manifest.yml`.
        + More than one worker folder can be defined under `/actions` as needed, however they must be registered in the `manifest.yml`.
+ `/test/asset-compute` contains the test suites for each worker. Similar to the `/actions` folder, `/test/asset-compute` can contain multiple sub-folders, each corresponding to the worker it tests.
    + `/test/asset-compute/worker`, representing a test suite for a specific worker, contains sub-folders representing a specific test-case, along with the test input, parameters, and expected output.
+ `/build` contains the output, logs, and artifacts of Asset Compute test case executions.
+ `/manifest.yml` defines what Asset Compute workers the project provides. Each worker implementation must be enumerated in this file to make them available to AEM as a Cloud Service.
+ `/.aio` contains configurations used by the aio CLI tool. This file can be configured via the `aio config` command.
+ `/.env` defines environment variables in a `key=value` syntax and contains secrets that should not be shared. To protect these secrets, this file should NOT be checked into Git and is ignored via the project's default `.gitignore` file. 
    + Variables defined in this file can be overridden by [exporting variables](../deploy/runtime.md) on the command line.

For more details on project structure review, review the [Anatomy of a Adobe Project Firefly application](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/getting_started/first_app.md#5-anatomy-of-a-project-firefly-application).

The bulk of the development takes place in the `/actions` folder developing worker implementations, and in `/test/asset-compute` writing tests for the custom Asset Compute workers.
