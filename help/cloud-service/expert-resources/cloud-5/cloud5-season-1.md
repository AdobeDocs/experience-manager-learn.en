# Cloud 5 season 1

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud 5 Series from AEM Engineering. One of the primary problems in the implementation phase of any product is having enough code samples and/or live demonstrations of those samples, tool, or APIs. The goal of this series is to deliver useful information about AEM as a Cloud Service in 5 minutes or less.

Each season varies in length and is released on a fixed schedule. Season 1's topics are primarily driven from past requests that we have come across in our day-to-day engagements with customers and partners. Visit this page for weekly updates or follow us on the social network of your choosing.
