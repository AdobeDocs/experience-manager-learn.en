# Cloud 5 season 1

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud 5 Series from AEM Engineering. One of the primary problems in the implementation phase of any product is having enough code samples and/or live demonstrations of those samples, tool, or APIs. The goal of this series is to deliver useful information about AEM as a Cloud Service in 5 minutes or less.
