## SPA Editor Deprecation{#spa-editor-deprecation}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The SPA Editor [has been deprecated](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/developing/hybrid/spa-editor-deprecation) for new projects. It remains supported by Adobe for existing projects, but should not be used for new projects. The preferred editors for managing headless content in AEM are now:
>
>* [The Universal Editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/wysiwyg-authoring/authoring) for visually editing headless content.
>* [The Content Fragment Editor](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/assets/content-fragments/content-fragments-managing) for form-based editing of headless content.
