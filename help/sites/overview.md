# AEM Sites videos and tutorials {#overview}

{{edge-delivery-services}}

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Sites is a leading experience management platform. This user guide contains videos and tutorials on the many features and capabilities of AEM Sites.

## Three ways to build with AEM Sites

AEM Sites provides three ways to build, author and deliver experiences. Whether you're building full pages, optimizing for edge performance, or powering headless apps, AEM Sites offers flexible options to match your project needs:

1. **Traditional Sites** use AEM Author's Page Editor to author content, which is then activated, and delivered  to end users by AEM Publish as HTML webpages.
1. **Edge Delivery Services** web sites leverage document-based authoring or Adobe Universal Editor to author content, which is then activated, and then delivered to end users by Edge Delivery Services as HTML webpages.
1. **Headless/API-first** web experiences use Content Fragment Editor or Universal Editor to author content, which is then activated, and delivered by AEM Publish as JSON.

These options are designed to meet the diverse needs of marketing organizations, to deliver personalized, engaging experiences at high-speed and scale across any channel or device.

The following diagram illustrates the different paths:
