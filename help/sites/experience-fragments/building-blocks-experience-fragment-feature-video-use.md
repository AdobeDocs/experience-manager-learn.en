>[!NOTE]

>Editable templates used for creating experience fragments should have the building block component added to its policies.

* Creating a building block makes it easy for content authors to re-use the content across different variations.
* Changing the master copy building block should automatically roll out changes to its references without cancelling inheritance or any layout changes. 
* Content authors can easily rename an existing building block or delete it.
* Deleting a building block from an Experience Fragment doesn't delete its references.
