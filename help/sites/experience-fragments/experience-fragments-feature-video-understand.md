An Experience Fragment is a set of content that grouped forms an experience that should make sense on its own.

With Experience Fragments marketers can:

* Reuse an experience across channels (both owned channels and 3rd party touch-points)

* Keep variations in sync with the use of Live-Copy
* Social Post experiences to Facebook and Pinterest out of the box
