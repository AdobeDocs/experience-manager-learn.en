An Experience Fragment is a grouped set of components that when combined creates an experience. For example, a *Title*, *Image*, *Description*, and *Call To Action Button* can be combined to form a teaser experience.

With Experience Fragments marketers can:

* Reuse an experience across channels (both owned channels and third-party touch-points)
* Create variations of an experience for specific use-cases
* Keep variations in sync with the use of Live  Copy
* Social Post experiences to Facebook and Pinterest out of the box
