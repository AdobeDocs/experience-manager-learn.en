# Personalization of full web page Experience {#personalization-fpe}

Learn how to create an activity to redirect your site pages that are hosted on AEM to a new page using Adobe Target.

## Prerequisites

To personalize full pages of an AEM web site, the following set-up must be completed:

1. [Add Adobe Target to your AEM web site](./add-target-launch-extension.md)
1. [Trigger an Adobe Target call from tags](./load-and-fire-target.md)

## Scenario overview

WKND site redesigned their home page and would like to redirect their current home page visitors to the new home page. At the same time, also understand how the redesigned home page helps to improve user engagement and revenue. As a marketer, you have been assigned the task to create an activity to redirect the visitors to the new home page. Let us explore the WKND site home page and learn how to create an activity using Adobe Target.

## Steps to create an A/B test using Visual Experience Composer (VEC)

1. Login to Adobe Target and navigate to the Activities tab
1. Click **Create Activity** button and then choose **A/B Test** activity
