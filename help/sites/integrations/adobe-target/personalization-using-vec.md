# Personalization using Visual Experience Composer {#personalization-vec}

Learn how to create an A/B Test Target Activity using Visual Experience Composer (VEC).

## Prerequisites

To use VEC on an AEM web site, the following set-up must be completed:

1. [Add Adobe Target to your AEM web site](./add-target-launch-extension.md)
1. [Trigger an Adobe Target call from Launch](./load-and-fire-target.md)

## Scenario Overview

The WKND site home page displays local activities or the best things to do around a city in the form of informational cards. As a marketer, you have been assigned the task to modify the home page, by making text changes to the adventure section teaser and understand how it improves conversion.

## Steps to create an A/B test using Visual Experience Composer (VEC)

1. Login to [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/), tap on __Target__,  navigate to the __Activities__ tab
    
    + If you do not see __Target__ on the Experience Cloud dashboard, ensure that the correct Adobe organization is selected in the organization switcher in the top right, and that user has been granted access to Target in [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/).

1. Click **Create Activity** button and then choose **A/B Test** activity

1. The Visual Experience Composer displays two tabs on the left side after you create an activity: *Experience A* and *Experience B*. Select an experience from the list. You can add new experiences to the list by using the **Add Experience** button.

1. Activate your saved activity to push your changes live.

1. Open your site page (Activity URL from step 3) in a new tab and you should be able to view either of the experiences (Adventure or Explore) from our A/B test activity.
