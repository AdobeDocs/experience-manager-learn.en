# Create Adobe Target Cloud Service account {#adobe-target-cloud-service}

The following video provides a walk through on how to connect AEM as a Cloud Service with Adobe Target. 

This integration allows the AEM Author service to communicate directly with Adobe Target, and push Experience Fragments from AEM to Target as offers.  This integration does *not* add Adobe Target JavaScript (AT.js) to AEM Sites web pages, for that integrate [AEM and tags using the Target extension](../experience-platform/data-collection/tags/connect-aem-tag-property-using-ims.md).

>There is a known issue with Adobe Target Cloud Services configuration shown in the video. Until this issue is resolved, follow the same steps in the video but use the [legacy Adobe Target Cloud Services configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/aem-target-tutorial/aem-target-implementation/using-aem-cloud-services.html).
