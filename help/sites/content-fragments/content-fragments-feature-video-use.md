# Authoring Content Fragments {#authoring-content-fragments}

Content Fragments are a content abstraction in AEM that allows text-based content to be authored and managed independently of the channels it supports.

AEM Content Fragments are text-based editorial content that may include some structured data elements associated but considered pure content without design or layout information. Content Fragments are typically created as channel-agnostic content, that is intended to be used and re-used across channels, which in turn wrap the content in a context-specific experience.

This video series covers the authoring life-cycle of Content Fragments in AEM. Details about [delivering Content Fragments can be found here](content-fragments-delivery-feature-video-use.md).

## Defining Content Fragment Models {#defining-content-fragment-models}

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/22452?quality=12&learn=on)

AEM Content Fragments Models, the data schemas of Content Fragments, must be enabled via AEM's [[!UICONTROL Configuration Browser]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/developing/configurations.html), which allows Content Fragment Models to be defined on a per configuration basis.

## Creating Content Fragments {#creating-content-fragments}

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/22451?quality=12&learn=on)

AEM configurations are applied to AEM Assets folder hierarchies to allow their Content Fragment Models to be created as Content Fragments. Content Fragments support a rich form-based authoring experience allowing content to be modeled as a collection of elements.

Content Fragments can have multiple variants, each variant addressing a different use-case (thought, not necessarily channel) for the content.

*Example athlete biography for import:*  
**[sandra-sprient-bio.txt](assets/sandra-sprient-bio.txt)**

## Downloading Content Fragments {#downloading-content-fragments}

AEM Content Fragments can be downloaded from AEM Author as a Zip file containing Variants, Elements, and Metadata.
