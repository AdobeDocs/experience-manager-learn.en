[AEM's externalizer](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/developing/using/externalizer.html) should be set up on both AEM Author and AEM Publish, to map the publish runmode to the publicly accessible domain used to access AEM Publish.

In this video we use `/etc/hosts` to spoof *www.example.com* to resolve to localhost, and use a [basic AEM Dispatcher configuration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-dispatcher/using/getting-started/dispatcher-install.html) to allow www.example.com to front AEM Publish.
