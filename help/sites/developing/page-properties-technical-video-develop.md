# Extending Page Properties {#extending-page-properties-in-aem-sites}

Customizing the metadata fields for the Page Properties is a common requirement in any Sites implementation. This video details the most effective way to accomplish this using features of the Sling Resource Merger.

>[!VIDEO](https://video.tv.adobe.com/v/25173?quality=12&learn=on)

The above video shows customizing the page properties for the [WKND Reference Site](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd).

## Sample WKND page properties package

You can use the provided [sample WKND page properties package](./assets/WKND-PageProperties-Example-Dialog-1.0.zip) containing **WKND** and **Basic** tab customizations shown in above video. The **SocialMedia** tab customization is not provided as [WKND Page component](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd/blob/main/ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/wknd/components/page/.content.xml#L5) now uses V3 version of WCM Core Components and in V3 version the [social sharing is deprecated](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/pull/1930). 

However for learning purposes, you can point the WKND Page component to V2 version of WCM Core Components using the `sling:resourceSuperType` property value and overlay the [Social Media](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/blob/main/content/src/content/jcr_root/apps/core/wcm/components/page/v2/page/_cq_dialog/.content.xml#L95) tab. For more information, see [Configuring your Page Properties](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/extending-aem/page-properties-views.html#configuring-your-page-properties)

This sample package should be installed on local AEM SDK or AEM 6.X.X instance for learning purposes.
