# Your AEM Sites Maturity Assessment Checklist

Assessing the current state of your AEM Sites instance can feel overwhelming. Generally, the best place to start is to audit your instance and now you can use this maturity assessment checklist to guide you through that process!

AEM maturity assessments primarily target on-premise and managed service implementations. Each AEM implementation is unique due to each customers' success definitions and goals set up during the discovery phase and pre-onboarding all the way to the AEM deployment phase. Maturity assessments play the role of post go-live health checks. 

Maturity assessments enable the evaluation and adherence to AEM standards and best practices. 

For best practices on administering, developing, or authoring, see the following resources: 

* [Administering best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/bestpractices/administer-best-practices.html?lang=en)
* [Developing best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/developing/bestpractices/best-practices.html?lang=en)
* [Authoring best practices](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/authoring/authoring/best-practices.html?lang=en)

Each one of these best practice areas above also includes further best practices in authoring, developing and deploying AEM.   

In most cases, the AEM maturity assessment will help to perform a diagnostic review of AEM best practices and will result in a roadmap for proactively discovering, resolving and preventing potential issues. It is recommended that assessments are completed with the teams that were also part of the AEM implementation discovery phase (pre-AEM migration). Roles that should be involved could include: Application owners, site owners, development teams, tech leads, security/infrastructure teams, SEO teams and support teams (e.g. content authors, admins). 

Recommended AEM maturity assessment areas of focus: Design and Architecture, Product management and strategy, Digital Asset Management and Delivery, Analytics, Testing and Security. 

Huge shoutout to AEM Champion Greg Dimeris for aggregating this information from multiple Experience League articles as well as his own best practices!
