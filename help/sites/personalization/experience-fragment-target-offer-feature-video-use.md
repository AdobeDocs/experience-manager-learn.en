* Adobe Experience Manager's easy-to-use and powerful content creating mechanism along with Adobe Target's Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning helps content authors to create and manage content for all channels in a centralized location. With the ability to export Experience Fragments into Adobe Target as HTML offers, marketers now have more flexibility to create a more personalized experience using these offers and can now test and scale each experience they create. 
* The main difference between the HTML offers and Experience Fragment offers is that editing for the later can only be done in AEM and then synchronized with Adobe Target
* Target Cloud service configuration applied to Experience Fragment folder inherits to all Experience Fragments created directly under the parent folder. Child folder doesn't inherit the parent cloud services configuration. 
* To create a personalized offer we can now easily leverage content stored within AEM.
* You can create types of Target activities, including the Sensei-powered activities like Auto-allocate, Auto Target, and Automated Personalization
