* Target Cloud service configuration applied to Experience Fragment folder inherits to all Experience Fragments created directly under the parent folder. Child folder doesn't inherit the parent cloud services configuration. 
* Target Client code can be obtained from Adobe Experience Cloud &gt; Launch Target &gt; Under Set Up Tab &gt; Implementation &gt; Edit at.js settings.
* Target API username and password can be obtained by submitting a ticket to Client Care with a request to enable the Experience Fragment Target Integration capability.
