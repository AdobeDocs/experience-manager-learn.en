Page versioning helps content authors to track changes associated with a page by creating a page version and provides an option to preview a version, restore a version, and compare a version with the current version of a page.

Versioning creates a snapshot of a page at a specific point in time. With versioning, you can perform the following actions:
* Create a new version for a page
* Restore a page to a previous version in order to undo a change that you made to a page, for example
* Compare the current version of a page with a previous version with differences in the text and images highlighted
