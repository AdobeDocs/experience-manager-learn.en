Editable Templates are the recommendation for building new AEM Sites.

**Consistent author experience** - Enhancements in AEM Sites authoring are carried over to Template editing including in-line Layout mode and Content Tree Panel.

**Advanced Policy configurations** - The following highlights some advanced policy configurations made available with Editable Templates:

* **Layout Container** - ability to configure Allowed Components, Manage the Drag + Drop mapping of Assets, and Responsive Grid columns.
* **Text Component** - ability to configure Rich Text Editor plugins with a new UI and re-use RTE policies across templates.
* **Image Component** - ability to turn on / turn off features such as cropping, desktop file-upload with a new UI and re-use Image policies across templates.

Editable Templates can be found under **Tools** `>` **General** `>` **Templates**.
