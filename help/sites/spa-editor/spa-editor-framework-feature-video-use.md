# Using the SPA Editor with AEM Sites {#using-the-spa-editor-with-aem-sites}

Video overview of authoring content for a Single Page Application in AEM Sites.

AEM's SPA Editor provides authors the ability to edit content for a Single Page Application or SPA. Developers using the framework of their choice (React or Angular) create a SPA and then map areas of the SPA to AEM components, allowing authors to use familiar AEM Sites editing tools. The below video demonstrates some of the in-context editing features with the WKND SPA sample site. The WKND SPA project includes both a React and Angular implementation.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The Single-Page Application (SPA) Editor feature requires AEM 6.4 service pack 2 or newer.
>
> The SPA Editor is the recommended solution for projects that require SPA framework based client-side rendering (e.g. React or Angular).

## Additional Resources {#additional-resources}

The WKND SPA implementation only provides support for AEM 6.4.8+, AEM 6.5.5+ and AEM as a Cloud Service.

Download and install the appropriate [WKND SPA package](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa/releases) based on your version of AEM. There are separate versions for **React** and **Angular**.
