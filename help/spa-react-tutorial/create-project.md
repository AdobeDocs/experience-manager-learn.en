# SPA Editor Project {#spa-editor-project}

Learn how to use an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Maven project as a starting point for a React application integrated with the AEM SPA Editor.

## Objective

1. Understand the structure of a new AEM SPA Editor project built from a Maven archetype.
2. Deploy the starter project to a local instance of AEM.

## What you will build

In this chapter, a new AEM project will be deployed, based on the [AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype). The AEM project will be bootstrapped with a very simple starting point for the React SPA. The project used in this chapter will serve as the basis for an implementation of the WKND SPA and will be built upon in future chapters.

*Starting site hierarchy for the WKND SPA.*

## Prerequisites

Review the required tooling and instructions for setting up a [local development environment](overview.md#local-dev-environment). Ensure that a fresh instance of Adobe Experience Manager, started in **author** mode, is running locally.

## Get the project

There are several options to create a Maven Multi-module project for AEM. This tutorial used the latest [AEM Project Archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype) as a basis for the tutorial code. Modifications have been made to the project code in order to support multiple versions of AEM. Please review [the note about backward compatibility](overview.md#compatibility).

> [!CAUTION]
> It is a best practice to use the **latest** version of the [archetype](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype) to generate a new project for a real-world implementation. AEM projects should target a single version of AEM using the `aemVersion` property of the archetype.

1. Download the starting point for this tutorial via git:

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa.git
    $ cd aem-guides-wknd-spa
    $ git checkout React/create-project-start
    ```

2. The following folder and file structure represents the AEM Project that was generated by the Maven archetype on the local file system:

    ```plain
    |--- aem-guides-wknd-spa
        |--- all/
        |--- core/
        |--- dispatcher/
        |--- ui.apps/
        |--- ui.apps.structure/
        |--- ui.content/
        |--- ui.frontend /
        |--- it.tests/
        |--- pom.xml
        |--- README.md
        |--- .gitignore
        |--- archetype.properties
    ```

3. The following properties were used when generating the AEM project from the [AEM Project archetype](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype/releases/tag/aem-project-archetype-14):

    | Property        | Value                               |
    |-----------------|-------------------------------------|
    | aemVersion      | cloud                               |
    | appTitle        | WKND SPA React                      |
    | appId           | wknd-spa-react                      |
    | groupId         | com.adobe.aem.guides                |
    | frontendModule  | react                               |
    | package         | com.adobe.aem.guides.wknd.spa.react |
    | includeExamples | n                                   |

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Notice the `frontendModule=react` property. This tells the AEM Project Archetype to bootstrap the project with a starter [React code base](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-react.html) to be used with the AEM SPA Editor.

## Build the project

Next, compile, build, and deploy the project code to a local instance of AEM using Maven.

1. Ensure an instance of AEM is running locally on port **4502**.
2. From the command line terminal verify that Maven is installed:

   ```shell
   $ mvn --version
    Apache Maven 3.6.2
    Maven home: /Library/apache-maven-3.6.2
    Java version: 11.0.4, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.0.4.jdk/Contents/Home
   ```

3. Run the below Maven command from the `aem-guides-wknd-spa` directory to build and deploy the project to AEM:

   ```shell
   $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
   ```

   If using [AEM 6.x](overview.md#compatibility):

   ```shell
   $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Pclassic
   ```

   The multiple modules of the project should be compiled and deployed to AEM.

   ```

   The Maven profile ***autoInstallSinglePackage*** compiles the individual modules of the project and deploys a single package to the AEM instance. By default this package will be deployed to an AEM instance running locally on port **4502** and with the credentials of **admin:admin**.

4. Navigate to **[!UICONTROL Package Manager]** on your local AEM instance: [http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp).

5. You should see three packages for `wknd-spa-react.all`, `wknd-spa-react.ui.apps` and `wknd-spa-react.ui.content`.

    ![WKND SPA Packages](./assets/create-project/package-manager.png)

    *AEM Package Manager*

    All of the custom code needed for the project will be bundled into these packages and installed on the AEM runtime.

6. You should also see several packages for `spa.project.core` and `core.wcm.components`. These dependencies are automatically included by the archetype. More information about [AEM Core Components can be found here](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/introduction.html).

    `spa.project.core` is a dependency needed to generate the JSON Model API that the SPA Editor expects.

## Author Content

Next, open the starter SPA that was generated by the archetype and update some of the content.

1. Navigate to the **[!UICONTROL Sites]** console: [http://localhost:4502/sites.html/content](http://localhost:4502/sites.html/content).

    The WKND SPA includes a basic site structure with a country, language and home page. This hierarchy is based on the archetype's default values for `language_country` and `isSingleCountryWebsite`. These values can be overwritten by updating the [available properties](https://github.com/adobe/aem-project-archetype#available-properties) when generating a project.

2. Open the **[!DNL us]** &gt; **[!DNL en]** &gt; **[!DNL WKND SPA React Home Page]** page by selecting the page and clicking the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** button in the menu bar:

    ![site console](./assets/create-project/open-home-page.png)

3. A **[!UICONTROL Text]** component has already been added to the page. You can edit this component like any other component in AEM.

    ![Update Text Component](./assets/create-project/update-text-component.gif)

4. Add an additional **[!UICONTROL Text]** component to the page.

    Notice that the authoring experience is similar to that of a traditional AEM Sites page. Currently a limited number of components are available to be used. More will be added over the course of the tutorial.

## Inspect the Single Page Application

Next, verify that this is a Single Page Application with the use of your browser's developer tools.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Page Editor]**, click the **[!UICONTROL Page Information]** button &gt; **[!UICONTROL View as Published]**:

    ![View as Published button](./assets/create-project/view-as-published.png)

    This will open a new tab with the query parameter `?wcmmode=disabled` which effectively turns off the AEM editor: [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html?wcmmode=disabled](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html?wcmmode=disabled)

2. View the page's source and notice that the text content **[!DNL Hello World]** or any of the other content is not found. Instead you should see HTML like the following:

    ```html
    ...
    <body>
        <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
        <div id="spa-root"></div>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="/etc.clientlibs/wknd-spa-react/clientlibs/clientlib-react.min.js"></script>
    </body>
    ...
    ```

    `clientlib-react.min.js` is the React SPA that is loaded on to the page and responsible for rendering the content.

    However, *where does the content come from?*

3. Return to the tab: [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html?wcmmode=disabled](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html?wcmmode=disabled)
4. Open the browser's developer tools and inspect the network traffic of the page during a refresh. View the **XHR** requests:

    ![XHR Requests](./assets/create-project/xhr-requests.png)

    There should be a request to [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json). This contains all of the content, formatted in JSON, that will drive the SPA. 

5. In a new tab open [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json)

    The request `en.model.json` represents the content model that will drive the application. Inspect the JSON output and you should be able to find the snippet representing the **[!UICONTROL Text]** component(s).

    ```json
    ...
    ":items": {
        "text": {
            "text": "<p>Hello World! Updated content!</p>\r\n",
            "richText": true,
            ":type": "wknd-spa-react/components/text"
        },
        "text_98796435": {
            "text": "<p>A new text component.</p>\r\n",
            "richText": true,
            ":type": "wknd-spa-react/components/text"
        },
    }
    ...
    ```

    In the next chapter we will inspect how this JSON content is mapped from AEM Components to SPA Components to form the basis of the AEM SPA Editor experience.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > It may be helpful to install a browser extension to automatically format the JSON output.

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}

Congratulations, you have just created your first AEM SPA Editor Project!

The SPA is quite simple. In the next few chapters more functionality will be added.
