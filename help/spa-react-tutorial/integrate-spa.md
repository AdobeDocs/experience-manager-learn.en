# Integrate a SPA {#integrate-spa}

Understand how the source code for a Single Page Application (SPA) written in React can be integrated with an Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Project. Learn to use modern front-end tools, like a webpack dev server, to rapidly develop the SPA against the AEM JSON model API.

## Objective

1. Understand how the SPA project is integrated with AEM with client-side libraries.
2. Learn how to use a webpack development server for dedicated front-end development.
3. Explore the use of a **proxy** and static **mock** file for developing against the AEM JSON Model API

## What you will build

This chapter will add a simple `Header` component to the SPA. In the process of building out this static `Header` component several approaches to AEM SPA development will be used.

*The SPA is extended to add a static `Header` component*

## Prerequisites

Review the required tooling and instructions for setting up a [local development environment](overview.md#local-dev-environment).

### Get the code

1. Download the starting point for this tutorial via git:

    ```shell
    $ git clone git@github.com:adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa.git
    $ cd aem-guides-wknd-spa
    $ git checkout React/integrate-spa-start
    ```

2. Deploy the code base to a local AEM instance using Maven:

    ```shell
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
    ```

    If using [AEM 6.x](overview.md#compatibility) add the `classic` profile:

    ```shell
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Pclassic
    ```

You can always view the finished code on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd-spa/tree/React/integrate-spa-solution) or check the code out locally by switching to the branch `React/integrate-spa-solution`.

## Integration approach {#integration-approach}

Two modules were created as part of the AEM project: `ui.apps` and `ui.frontend`.

The `ui.frontend` module is a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) project that contains all of the SPA source code. A majority of the SPA development and testing will be done in the webpack project. When a production build is triggered, the SPA is built and compiled using webpack. The compiled artifacts (CSS and Javascript) are copied into the `ui.apps` module which is then deployed to the AEM runtime.

![ui.frontend high-level architecture](assets/integrate-spa/ui-frontend-architecture.png)

*A high-level depiction of the SPA integration.*

Additional information about the Front-end build can be [found here](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-react.html).

## Inspect the SPA integration {#inspect-spa-integration}

Next, inspect the `ui.frontend` module to understand the SPA that has been auto-generated by the [AEM Project archetype](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-core-components/using/developing/archetype/uifrontend-react.html).

1. In the IDE of your choice open up the AEM Project for the WKND SPA. This tutorial will use the [Visual Studio Code IDE](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/development-tools.html#microsoft-visual-studio-code).

    ![VSCode - AEM WKND SPA Project](./assets/integrate-spa/vscode-ide-openproject.png)

2. Expand and inspect the `ui.frontend` folder. Open the file `ui.frontend/package.json`

3. Under the `dependencies` you should see several related to `react` including `react-scripts`

    ```json
    "react": "^16.12.0",
    "react-app-polyfill": "^1.0.5",
    "react-dom": "^16.12.0",
    "react-router-dom": "^5.1.2",
    "react-scripts": "3.4.1"
    ```

    The `ui.frontend` is a React application based on the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or CRA for short. The `react-scripts` version indicates which version of CRA is used.

4. There are also three dependencies prefixed with `@adobe`:

    ```json
    "@adobe/cq-react-editable-components": "^1.2.0",
    "@adobe/cq-spa-component-mapping": "^1.0.3",
    "@adobe/cq-spa-page-model-manager": "^1.1.0",
    ```

    The above modules make up the [AEM SPA Editor JS SDK](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/experience-manager-65/developing/headless/spas/spa-blueprint.html) and provide the functionality to make it possible to map SPA Components to AEM Components.

5. In the `package.json` file there are several `scripts` defined:

    ```json
    "scripts": {
        "start": "react-scripts start",
        "build": "react-scripts build && clientlib",
        "test": "react-scripts test",
        "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    }
    ```

    These are standard build scripts made [available](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts) by the Create React App.

    The only difference is the addition of `&& clientlib` to the `build` script. This extra instruction is responsible for copying the compiled SPA into the `ui.apps` module as a client-side library during a build.

    The npm module [aem-clientlib-generator](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator) is used to facilitate this.

6. Inspect the file `ui.frontend/clientlib.config.js`. This configuration file is used by [aem-clientlib-generator](https://github.com/wcm-io-frontend/aem-clientlib-generator#clientlibconfigjs) to determine how to generate the client library.

7. Inspect the file `ui.frontend/pom.xml`. This file transforms the `ui.frontend` folder into a [Maven module](http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html). The `pom.xml` file has been updated to use the [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) to **test** and **build** the SPA during a Maven build.

8. Inspect the file `index.js` at `ui.frontend/src/index.js`:

    ```js
    //ui.frontend/src/index.js
    ...
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
        ModelManager.initialize().then(pageModel => {
            const history = createBrowserHistory();
            render(
            <Router history={history}>
                <App
                history={history}
                cqChildren={pageModel[Constants.CHILDREN_PROP]}
                cqItems={pageModel[Constants.ITEMS_PROP]}
                cqItemsOrder={pageModel[Constants.ITEMS_ORDER_PROP]}
                cqPath={pageModel[Constants.PATH_PROP]}
                locationPathname={window.location.pathname}
                />
            </Router>,
            document.getElementById('spa-root')
            );
        });
    });
    ```

    `index.js` is the entrypoint of the SPA. `ModelManager` is provided by the AEM SPA Editor JS SDK. It is responsible for calling and injecting the `pageModel` (the JSON content) into the application.

## Add a Header component {#header-component}

Next, add a new component to the SPA and deploy the changes to a local AEM instance.

1. In the `ui.frontend` module, beneath `ui.frontend/src/components` create a new folder named `Header`.
2. Create a file named `Header.js` beneath the `Header` folder.

    ![Header folder and file](assets/integrate-spa/header-folder-js.png)

3. Populate `Header.js` with the following:

    ```js
    //Header.js
    import React, {Component} from 'react';

    export default class Header extends Component {

        render() {
            return (
                    <header className="Header">
                        <div className="Header-container">
                            <h1>WKND</h1>
                        </div>
                    </header>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

    Above is a standard React component that will output a static text string.

4. Open the file `ui.frontend/src/App.js`. This is the application entry-point.
5. Make the following updates to `App.js` to include the static `Header`:

    ```diff
      import { Page, withModel } from '@adobe/cq-react-editable-components';
      import React from 'react';
    + import Header from './components/Header/Header';

      // This component is the application entry point
      class App extends Page {
      render() {
          return (
          <div>
    +       <Header /> 
             {this.childComponents}
             {this.childPages}
         </div>
    ```

6. Open a new terminal and navigate into the `ui.frontend` folder and run the `npm run build` command:

    ```shell
    $ cd aem-guides-wknd-spa
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm run build
    ...
    Compiled successfully.

    File sizes after gzip:

    118.95 KB (-33 B)  build/static/js/2.489f399a.chunk.js
    1.11 KB (+48 B)    build/static/js/main.6cfa5095.chunk.js
    806 B              build/static/js/runtime-main.42b998df.js
    451 B              build/static/css/main.e57bbe8a.chunk.css
    ```

7. Navigate to the `ui.apps` folder. Beneath `ui.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/wknd-spa-react/clientlibs/clientlib-react` you should see the compiled SPA files have been copied from  the`ui.frontend/build` folder. 

    ![Client library generated in ui.apps](./assets/integrate-spa/compiled-spa-uiapps.png)

8. Return to the terminal and navigate into the `ui.apps` folder. Execute the following Maven command:

    ```shell
    $ cd ../ui.apps
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage
    ...
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time:  9.629 s
    [INFO] Finished at: 2020-05-04T17:48:07-07:00
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ```

    This will deploy the `ui.apps` package to a local running instance of AEM.

9. Open a browser tab and navigate to [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html). You should now see the contents of the `Header` component being displayed in the SPA.

    ![Initial header implementation](./assets/integrate-spa/initial-header-implementation.png)

    Steps 6-8 are executed automatically when triggering a Maven build from the root of the project (i.e `mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage`). You should now understand the basics of the integration between the SPA and AEM client-side libraries. Notice that you can still edit and add `Text` components in AEM beneath the static `Header` component.

## Webpack Dev Server - Proxy the JSON API {#proxy-json}

As seen in the previous exercises, performing a build and syncing the client library to a local instance of AEM takes a few minutes. This is acceptable for final testing, but is not ideal for the majority of the SPA development.

A [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) can be used to rapidly develop the SPA. The SPA is driven by a JSON model generated by AEM. In this exercise the JSON content from a running instance of AEM will be **proxied** into the development server.

1. Return to the IDE and open the file `ui.frontend/package.json`.

    Look for a line like the following:

    ```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:4502",
    ```

    The [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development) provides an easy mechanism to proxy API requests. All unknown requests will be proxied through `localhost:4502`, the local AEM quickstart.

2. Open a terminal window and navigate to the `ui.frontend` folder. Run the command `npm start`:

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm start
    ...
    Compiled successfully!

    You can now view wknd-spa-react in the browser.

    Local:            http://localhost:3000
    On Your Network:  http://192.168.86.136:3000

    Note that the development build is not optimized.
    To create a production build, use npm run build.
    ```

3. Open a new browser tab (if not already opened) and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html).

    ![Webpack dev server - proxy json](./assets/integrate-spa/webpack-dev-server-1.png)

    You should see the same content as in AEM, but without any of the authoring capabilities enabled.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Due to the security requirements of AEM, you will need to be logged into the local AEM instance (http://localhost:4502) in the same browser but in a different tab.

4. Return to the IDE and create a new folder named `media` at `ui.frontend/src/media`.
5. Download and add the following WKND logo to the `media` folder:

    ![WKND logo](./assets/integrate-spa/wknd-logo-dk.png)

6. Open `Header.js` at `ui.frontend/src/components/Header/Header.js` and import the logo:

    ```diff
      import React, {Component} from 'react';
    + import wkndLogoDark from '../../media/wknd-logo-dk.png';
    ```

7. Make the following updates to `Header.js` to include the logo as part of the header:

    ```js
     export default class Header extends Component {

        get logo() {
            return (
                <div className="Logo">
                    <img className="Logo-img" src={wkndLogoDark} alt="WKND SPA" />
                </div>
            );
        }

        render() {
            return (
                    <header className="Header">
                        <div className="Header-container">
                            {this.logo}
                        </div>
                    </header>
            );
        }
    }
    ```

    Save the changes to `Header.js`.

8. Return to the browser at [http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html). You should immediately see the changes to the app reflected.

    ![Logo added to header](./assets/integrate-spa/added-logo-localhost.png)

    You can continue to make content updates in AEM and see them reflected in **webpack-dev-server**, since we are proxying the content.

9. Stop the webpack dev server with `ctrl+c` in the terminal.

## Webpack Dev Server - Mock JSON API {#mock-json}

Another approach to rapid development is to use a static JSON file to act as the JSON model. By "mocking" the JSON, we remove the dependency on a local AEM instance. It also allows a front-end developer to update the JSON model in order to test functionality and drive changes to the JSON API that would then be later implemented by a back-end developer.

The initial set up of the mock JSON does **require a local AEM instance**.

1. In the browser navigate to [http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json](http://localhost:4502/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json).

    This is the JSON exported by AEM that is driving the application. Copy the JSON output.

2. Return to the IDE navigate to `ui.frontend/public` and add a new folder named `mock-content`.
3. Create a new file named `mock.model.json` beneath `ui.frontend/public/mock-content`. Paste the JSON output from **Step 1** here.

    ![Mock Model Json file](./assets/integrate-spa/mock-model-json-created.png)

4. Open the file `index.html` at `ui.frontend/public/index.html`. Update the metadata property for the AEM page model to point to a variable `%REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH%`:

    ```html
        <!-- AEM page model -->
        <meta
           property="cq:pagemodel_root_url"
           content="%REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH%"
        />
    ```

    Using a variable for the value of the `cq:pagemodel_root_url` will make it easier to toggle between the proxy and mock json model.

5. Open the file `ui.frontend/.env.development` and make the following updates to comment out the previous value for `REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH`:

    ```plain
    PUBLIC_URL=/

    #REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH=/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json
    REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH=/mock-content/mock.model.json

    REACT_APP_ROOT=/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html
    ```

6. If currently running, stop the **webpack-dev-server**. Start the **webpack-dev-server** from the terminal:

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm start
    ```

    Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:3000/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html) and you should see the SPA with the same content used in the **proxy** json.

7. Make a small change to the `mock.model.json` file created earlier. You should see the updated content immediately reflected in the **webpack-dev-server**.

    ![mock model json update](./assets/integrate-spa/webpack-mock-model.gif)

Being able to manipulate the JSON model and see the effects on a live SPA can help a developer understand the JSON model API. It also allows both front-end and back-end development happen in parallel.

You can now toggle where to consume the JSON content by toggling the entries in the `env.development` file:

```plain
# JSON API via proxy to AEM
#REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH=/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en.model.json

# JSON API via static mock file
REACT_APP_PAGE_MODEL_PATH=/mock-content/mock.model.json
```

## Add Styles with Sass

A React best practice is to keep each component modular and self contained. A general recommendation is to avoid re-using the same CSS class name across components, which make the use of preprocessors not as powerful. This project will use [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for a few useful features like variables. This project will also loosely follow [SUIT CSS naming conventions](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/components.md). SUIT is a variation of BEM notation, Block Element Modifier, used to create consistent CSS rules.

1. Open a terminal window and stop the **webpack-dev-server** if started. From inside the `ui.frontend` folder enter the following command to [install Sass](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet):

    ```shell
    $ cd ui.frontend
    $ npm install node-sass --save
    ```

    Install `sass` as a peer-dependency:

    ```shell
    $ npm install sass --save
    ```

2. Install `normalize-scss` to normalize the styles across browsers: 

    ```shell
    $ npm install normalize-scss
    ```

3. Start the **webpack-dev-server** so that we can see the styles updating in real-time:

    ```shell
    $ npm start
    ```

    Use either the Proxy of Mock approach for handling the JSON model API.

4. Return to the IDE and beneath `ui.frontend/src` create a new folder named `styles`.
5. Create a new file beneath `ui.frontend/src/styles` named `_variables.scss` and populate it with the following variables:

    ```scss
    //_variables.scss

    //== Colors
    //
    //## Gray and brand colors for use across theme.

    $black:                  #202020;
    $gray:                   #696969;
    $gray-light:             #EBEBEB;
    $gray-lighter:           #F7F7F7;
    $white:                  #FFFFFF;
    $yellow:                 #FFEA00;
    $blue:                   #0045FF;


    //== Typography
    //
    //## Font, line-height, and color for body text, headings, and more.

    $font-family-sans-serif:  "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
    $font-family-serif:       Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
    $font-family-base:        $font-family-sans-serif;
    $font-size-base:          18px;

    $line-height-base:        1.5;
    $line-height-computed:    floor(($font-size-base * $line-height-base));

    // Functional Colors
    $brand-primary:             $yellow;
    $body-bg:                   $white;
    $text-color:                $black;
    $text-color-inverse:        $gray-light;
    $link-color:                $blue;

    //Layout
    $max-width: 1024px;

    // Spacing
    $gutter-padding: 12px;
    ```

6. Re-name the extension of the file `index.css` at `ui.frontend/src/index.css` to **`index.scss`**. Replace the contents with the following:

    ```scss
    /* index.scss * /

    /* Normalize */
    @import '~normalize-scss/sass/normalize';

    @import './styles/variables';

    body {
        background-color: $body-bg;
        font-family: $font-family-base;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-size: $font-size-base;
        text-align: left;
        color: $text-color;
        line-height: $line-height-base;
    }

    //spacing for header
    body.page {
        padding-top: 75px;
    }
    ```

7. Update `ui.frontend/src/index.js` to include the re-named `index.scss`:

    ```diff
     ...
    - import './index.css';
    + import './index.scss';
     ....
    ```

8. Create a new file named `Header.scss` beneath `ui.frontend/src/components/Header`. Populate the file with the following:

    ```scss
    @import '../../styles/variables';

    .Header {
        width: 100%;
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left:0;
        z-index: 99;
        background-color: $brand-primary;
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 0px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.24);
    }

    .Header-container {
        display: flex;
        max-width: $max-width;
        margin: 0 auto;
        padding-left: $gutter-padding;
        padding-right: $gutter-padding;
    }

    .Logo {
        z-index: 100;
        display: flex;
        padding-top: $gutter-padding;
        padding-bottom: $gutter-padding;
    }

    .Logo-img {
        width: 100px;
    }
    ```

9. Include `Header.scss` by updating `Header.js`:

    ```js
    import React, {Component} from 'react';
    import wkndLogoDark from '../../media/wknd-logo-dk.png';

    require('./Header.scss');

    You should now see the updated styles added to the `Header` component.

## Deploy SPA updates to AEM

The changes made to the `Header` are currently only visible through the **webpack-dev-server**. Deploy the updated SPA to AEM to see the changes.

1. Navigate to the root of the project (`aem-guides-wknd-spa`) and deploy the project to AEM using Maven:

    ```shell
    $ cd ..
    $ mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage
    ```

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html](http://localhost:4502/editor.html/content/wknd-spa-react/us/en/home.html). You should see the updated `Header` with logo and styles applied.

    Now that the updated SPA is in AEM, authoring can continue.

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}
