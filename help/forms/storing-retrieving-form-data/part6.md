To test this capability on your AEM Forms instance, please follow the following steps

* Download and deploy the [MySql Driver Jar](assets/mysqldriver.jar) files using the [felix web console](http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles)
* Download and deploy the [OSGi bundle](assets/SaveAndContinue.SaveAndContinue.core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) using the [felix web console](http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles)
* Download and install the [package containing client lib, adaptive form template, and the custom page component](assets/store-and-fetch-af-with-data.zip) using the [package manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp)
* Import the [sample Adaptive form](assets/sample-adaptive-form.zip) using the [FormsAndDocuments interface](http://localhost:4502/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments)

* Import the [form-data-db.sql](assets/form-data-db.sql) using MySql Workbench. This will create the necessary schema and tables in your database for this tutorial to work.
* Login to [configMgr.](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr) Search for "Apache Sling Connection Pooled DataSource. Create a new Apache Sling Connection Pooled Datasource entry called **SaveAndContinue** using the following properties:

| Property Name| Value |
| ------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Datasource Name| `SaveAndContinue` |
| JDBC Driver Class| `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver` |
| JDBC connection uri| `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/aemformstutorial` |

* Open the [Adaptive Form](http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/demostoreandretrieveformdata/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled)
* Fill in some details and click on the "Save And Continue Later" button.
* You should get back a URL with a GUID in it.
* Copy the URL and paste it in a new browser tab. **Make sure there are no empty space at the end of the URL.**
* Adaptive Form should get populated with the data from the previous step.
