# Variables in AEM Workflow

Starting with AEM 6.5 you can now create and use variables in AEM Workflow. Prior to this capability, workflow authors typically created keys using the workflow metadata map. This meant writing some custom code to create and populate these keys. With this new capability workflow, authors can now easily create variables and use these variables anywhere in the workflow.

The variables can be of the following types

* Long
* Double
* Boolean
* String
* Date
* JSON
* XML
* ArrayList
* FormDataModel
* Document
