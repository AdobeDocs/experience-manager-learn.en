# Store form attachments

When you add attachments to an adaptive form, the attachments are stored in a temporary location in the CRX repository. For our use case to work we need to store the form attachments in a new location in the CRX repository.

OSGi service is created to store the form attachments in a new location in the CRX repository. A new file map is created with the new location of the attachments in the CRX and returned to the calling application.
The following is the FileMap that is sent to the servlet. The key is the adaptive form field and the value is the temporary location of the attachment. In our servlet we will extract the attachment and store it in new location in the AEM repository and update the FileMap with the new location

```java
{
"guide[0].guide1[0].guideRootPanel[0].idDocumentPanel[0].idcard[0]": "idcard/CA-DriversLicense.pdf",
"guide[0].guide1[0].guideRootPanel[0].documentation[0].yourBankStatements[0].table1603552612235[0].Row1[0].tableItem11[0]": "tableItem11/BankStatement-Sept-2020.pdf"
}
```

The following is the code which extracts the attachments from the request and stores them under **/content/afattachments** folder

```java
public String storeAFAttachments(JSONObject fileMap, SlingHttpServletRequest request) {
    JSONObject newFileMap = new JSONObject();
    try {
        Iterator keys = fileMap.keys();
        log.debug("The file map is " + fileMap.toString());
        while (keys.hasNext()) {
            String key = (String) keys.next();
            log.debug("#### The key is " + key);
            String attacmenPath = (String) fileMap.get((key));
            log.debug("The attachment path is " + attacmenPath);
            if (!attacmenPath.contains("/content/afattachments")) {
                String fileName = attacmenPath.split("/")[1];
                log.debug("#### The attachment name  is " + fileName);
                InputStream is = request.getPart(attacmenPath).getInputStream();
                Document aemFDDocument = new Document(is);
                String crxPath = saveDocumentInCrx("/content/afattachments", fileName, aemFDDocument);
                log.debug(" ##### written to crx repository  " + attacmenPath.split("/")[1]);
                newFileMap.put(key, crxPath);
            } else {
                log.debug("$$$$ The attachment was already added " + key);
                log.debug("$$$$ The attachment path is " + attacmenPath);
                int position = attacmenPath.indexOf("//");
                log.debug("$$$$ After substring " + attacmenPath.substring(position + 1));
                log.debug("$$$$ After splitting " + attacmenPath.split("/")[1]);
                newFileMap.put(key, attacmenPath.substring(position + 1));
            }
        }
    } catch (Exception ex) {
        log.debug(ex.getMessage());
    }
    return newFileMap.toString();

}


}
```

This is the new FileMap with the updated location of the form attachments

```java
{
"guide[0].guide1[0].guideRootPanel[0].idDocumentPanel[0].idcard[0]": "/content/afattachments/7dc0cbde-404d-49a9-9f7b-9ab5ee7482be/CA-DriversLicense.pdf",
"guide[0].guide1[0].guideRootPanel[0].documentation[0].yourBankStatements[0].table1603552612235[0].Row1[0].tableItem11[0]": "/content/afattachments/81653de9-4967-4736-9ca3-807a11542243/BankStatement-Sept-2020.pdf"
}
```
