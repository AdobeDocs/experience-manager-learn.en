Interactive Communications allow the agents prepraing ad-hoc correspondences to save partially completed correspondences and retrieve the same to continue working. AEM Forms provides you the [Service Provider Interface](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/forms/javadocs/com/adobe/fd/ccm/ccr/ccrDocumentInstance/api/services/CCRDocumentInstanceService.html).
