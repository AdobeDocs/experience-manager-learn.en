# AEM Inbox

AEM Inbox consolidates notifications and tasks from various AEM components, including Forms workflows. When a forms workflow containing an Assign task step is triggered, the associated application is listed as a task in the assignee's Inbox.

The Inbox user interface provides list and calendar views to view tasks. You can also configure the view settings. You can filter tasks based on various parameters.
 
You can customize an Experience Manager Inbox to change the default title of a column, reorder the position of a column, and display additional columns based on the data of a workflow.
