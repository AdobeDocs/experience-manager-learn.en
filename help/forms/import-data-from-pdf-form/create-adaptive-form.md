# Introduction

The first step is to create a schema based on the data that will be used to populate the adaptive form. 

## XFA is based on a schema
 
Use the schema to create your adaptive form

## XFA is not based on a schema

* Open the XDP in AEM Forms designer. 
* Click File | Form Properties | Preview.
* Click Generate Preview Data.
* Click Generate.
* Provide a meaningful file name such as `form-data.xml`

You can use any of the free online tools to [generate XSD](https://www.freeformatter.com/xsd-generator.html) from the xml data generated in the previous step.

Create an adaptive form based on the schema from the previous step.

>[!NOTE]
>It is always recommended to examine the data that is generated on the Adaptive Form submission. This will give you a good idea of the XML format of the data that needs to be merged with the adaptive form.

Data submitted from Adaptive form
![submitted-data](./assets/af-submitted-data.png)

Data exported from the PDF
![exported-data](./assets/exported-data.png)

Form the exported data, you will have to extract the **_topmostSubform_** node with the appropriate namespaces preserved for successfully merging data with the adaptive form.
