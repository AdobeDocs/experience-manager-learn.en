# Simplified Steps for Installing AEM Forms on Windows

>[!NOTE]
>Never double click the AEM Quick Start jar, if you intend to use AEM Forms.
>Also, make sure there are no spaces in the AEM Forms Installation folder path.
>For Example do not install AEM Forms in c:\jack and jill\AEM Forms folder

>[!NOTE]
If you are installing AEM Forms 6.5, Please make sure you have installed the following 32 bit Microsoft Visual C++ redistributables.

* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 redistributable
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 redistributable
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 redistributable
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 redistributable (as of 6.5)

Although we recommend following the [official documentation](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/forms/using/installing-configuring-aem-forms-osgi.html) for installing AEM Forms. The following steps can be followed to install and configure AEM Forms on Windows environment:

* Make sure you have the appropriate JDK installed
   * AEM 6.2 you need: Oracle SE 8 JDK 1.8.x (64bit)
*    * AEM 6.3 and AEM 6.4 you need: Oracle SE 8 JDK 1.8.x (64bit)
   * AEM 6.5 you need JDK 8 or JDK 11
   * [Official JDK Requirements](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/sites/deploying/using/technical-requirements.html) are listed here
*  Make sure the JAVA_HOME is set to point to the JDK you have installed.
    *  To create the JAVA_HOME variable in windows follow the steps below:
       * Right-click My Computer and select Properties
        * On the Advanced tab, select Environment Variables and create a new system variable called JAVA_HOME.
        * Set the variable value to point to JDK installed on your system. For example c:\program files\java\jdk1.8.0_25

* Create a folder called AEMForms on your C drive
* Locate the AEMQuickStart.Jar and move it into AEMForms folder
* Copy the license.properties file into this AEMForms folder
* Create a batch file called "StartAemForms.bat" with the following content:
    * java -d64 -Xmx2048M -jar AEM_6.3_Quickstart.jar -gui.Here AEM_6.3_Quickstart.jar is the name of my AEM quickstart jar.
    * You can rename your jar to any name, but please make sure that name is reflected in the batch file.Save the batch file in the AEMForms Folder.

* Open a new command prompt, and navigate to c:\aemforms.

* Execute the StartAemForms.bat file from the command prompt.

* You should get a small dialog box indicating the progress of the startup.

* Once the startup is complete, open the sling.propertiesfile. This is located in c:\AEMForms\crx-quickstart\conf folder.

* Copy the following 2 lines towards the bottom of the file
    * **sling.bootdelegation.class.com.rsa.jsafe.provider.JsafeJCE=com.rsa.&#42;** **sling.bootdelegation.class.org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider=org.bouncycastle.&#42;**
* These two properties are required for document services to work
* Save the sling.properties file

* [Login to package share](http://localhost:4502/crx/packageshare/login.html)

    * You will need AdobeId to login to package share
    * Search for AEM Forms Add on package appropriate for your version of AEM Forms and Operating System
    * Or [you can download the appropriate forms addon package](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/kb/aem-forms-releases.html)
    * After you have installed the add on package the following steps need to be followed

        * **Make sure all the bundles are in active state. (Except for AEMFD Signatures bundle).**
        * **It would typically take 5 or more minutes for all the bundles to get to active state.**

    * **Once all the bundles are active(Except the AEMFD Signatures bundle), restart your system to complete the AEM Forms installation**

* Add `sun.util.calendar` package to the allowed list:

  1. Open Felix web console in your [browser window](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
  2. Search and open Deserialization Firewall Configuration: `com.adobe.cq.deserfw.impl.DeserializationFirewallImpl`
  3. Add `sun.util.calendar` as a new entry under `com.adobe.cq.deserfw.impl.DeserializationFirewallImpl.firewall.deserialization.whitelist.name`
  4. Save the changes.
