# Using API to generate Document of Record in AEM Forms {#using-api-to-generate-document-of-record-with-aem-forms}

Generate Document Of Record (DOR) programmatically

This article illustrates the use of the `com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoRService API` to generate **Document of Record** programmatically. [Document of Record](https://helpx.adobe.com/aem-forms/6-5/generate-document-of-record-for-non-xfa-based-adaptive-forms.html#Document of Record Template Configuration) is a PDF version of the data captured in Adaptive Form.

1. The following is the code snippet. The first line gets the DOR Service.
1. Then we set the DoROptions.
1. Then we invoke the render method of the DoRService and pass the DoROptions object to the render method

```java {.line-numbers}
com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoRService dorService = sling.getService(com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoRService.class);
com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoROptions dorOptions =  new com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoROptions();
 dorOptions.setData(dataXml);
 dorOptions.setFormResource(resource);
 java.util.Locale locale = new java.util.Locale("en");
 dorOptions.setLocale(locale);
 com.adobe.aemds.guide.addon.dor.DoRResult dorResult = dorService.render(dorOptions);
 byte[] fileBytes = dorResult.getContent();
 com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document dorDocument = new com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document(fileBytes);

```

To try this on your local system, please follow the following steps

1. [Download and install the article assets using package manager](assets/dorapi.zip)

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:4502/useradmin](http://localhost:4502/useradmin)
1. Search for user ' data '
1. Double click the ' data ' user 
1. Open the permissions tab
1. Give Read, Modify and Create permissions on `/content/usergenerated/content/aemformsenablement` node
1. Save your changes
1. [Open the form](http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/sandbox/1201-borrower-payments/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled)
