To test this capability on your server, follow the below instructions

* Setup tomcat with SampleRest.war file as described [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/kt/forms/using/preparing-datasource-for-form-data-model-tutorial-use.html).The war file deployed in Tomcat has the code to return the applicant's credit score.The credit score is random number between 200 and 800

* [ Import the assets into AEM using package manager](assets/aem65-loanapplication.zip)
* The package contains the following:

  * Workflow model which uses FDM step.
  * Form Data Model that is used in the FDM step.
  * Adaptive form to trigger the workflow on submission.
* Open the [MortgageApplicationForm](http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/loanapplication/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled). Fill in the details and submit. On the form submission the [loanapplication workflow](http://http://localhost:4502/editor.html/conf/global/settings/workflow/models/LoanApplication2.html) is triggered.

 The workflow utilizes Or Split component to route the application to admin if the credit score is over 500. If the credit score is less than 500 the application is routed to cavery.
