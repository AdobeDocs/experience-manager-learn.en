# Merge data with the XDP template

The next step is to merge the XML data with the template to generate the PDF. This PDF is then sent for signatures using Adobe Sign.

## Using OutputService to generate the PDF

The [generatePDF](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/forms/javadocs/com/adobe/fd/output/api/OutputService.html#generatePDFOutput-com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document-com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document-com.adobe.fd.output.api.PDFOutputOptions-) method of the OutputService was used to generate the PDF.
The generated PDF was then sent for signatures using the Adobe Sign REST API.
