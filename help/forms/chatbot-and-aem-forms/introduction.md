# Fill out a PDF form using ChatBot

Welcome to our tutorial on using a ChatBot to fill a PDF form with Adobe Experience Manager Forms (AEM Forms) and sending it for digital signature using Adobe Sign.

The ChatBot was created using [chatbot](https://www.chatbot.com/).

For the purpose of this tutorial we will be merging data captured in ChatBot with a [W-9 form](assets/fw9.xdp)
