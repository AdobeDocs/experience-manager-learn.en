# Creating workflow to review submitted data

Workflows are typically used to route submitted data for review and approval. Workflows are created using the workflow editor in AEM. The Workflows can be triggered on Adaptive Form submission. 

## Prerequisite

Please make sure you have a working instance of AEM Forms. Please follow the [installation guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/forms/install-aem-forms/osgi-installation/installing-configuring-aem-forms-osgi.html) to install and configure AEM Forms

The following video explains the creation of Review and Approval workflow using AEM Forms Components

If for some reason you are not able to build the workflow, you can download the completed workflow from [here](assets/review-submitted-data-workflow.zip) and import the same using [package manager](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp) in to your AEM instance.
