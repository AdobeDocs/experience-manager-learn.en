# Workflow to review and approve the submitted PDF

The last and final step is to create AEM workflow which will generate a static, or non-interactive, PDF for review and approval. Workflow is triggered via an AEM Launcher configured on the node `/content/pdfsubmissions`.

The following screenshot shows the steps involved in the workflow.
