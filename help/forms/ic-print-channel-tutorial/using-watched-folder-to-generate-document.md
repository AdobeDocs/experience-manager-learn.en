# Generating Print Channel Documents Using Watched Folder

In this part, we will generate print channel documents using the watched folder mechanism.

After creating and testing your print channel document, we need a mechanism to generate these document in batch mode or on demand. Typically, these kinds of documents are generated in batch mode and the most common mechanism is using watched folder.

When you configure a watched folder in AEM, you associate an ECMA script or java code that gets executed when a file is dropped into the watched folder. In this article, we will focus on ECMA script which will generate print channel documents and save them to the file system.

The watched folder configuration and the ECMA script are part of the assets you imported at the [beginning of this tutorial](introduction.md)

The input file that is dropped into the watched folder has the following structure. ECMA script reads the account numbers and generates print channel document for each of these accounts.

For more details on the ECMA script for generating documents, [refer to this article](/help/forms/interactive-communications/generating-interactive-communications-print-document-using-api-tutorial-use.md)

```xml
<accountnumbers>
 <accountnumber>509840</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>948576</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>398762</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>291723</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>291724</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>291725</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>291726</accountnumber>
 <accountnumber>291727</accountnumber>
</accountnumbers>
```

To generate print channel document using the watched folder mechanism, please follow the steps below:

* [Follow the steps mentioned in this document](/help/forms/adaptive-forms/service-user-tutorial-develop.md)

* Login to crx and navigate to /etc/fd/watchfolder/scripts/PrintPDF.ecma

```xml
<accountnumbers>
<accountnumber>1</accountnumber>
<accountnumber>100</accountnumber>
<accountnumber>101</accountnumber>
<accountnumber>1009</accountnumber>
<accountnumber>10009</accountnumber>
<accountnumber>11990</accountnumber>
