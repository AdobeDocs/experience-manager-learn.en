In this part, we will add images and text content to the target areas defined in the layout(xdp). 

Now that you have authored your first document fragment that will hold the recipient name and address, we will need to add the document fragment to the print channel document.

You can add content of various types such as Document Fragments, Images, Layout Fragments etc to the print channel document.

To add content to the print channel document, please follow the video below.
