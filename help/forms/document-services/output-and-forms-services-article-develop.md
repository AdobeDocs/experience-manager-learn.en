# Developing with Output and Forms Services in AEM Forms{#developing-with-output-and-forms-services-in-aem-forms}

Learn about developing with Output and Forms Service API in AEM Forms.

In this article we will take a look at the following

* [Output Service](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/forms/javadocs/index.html?com/adobe/fd/output/api/OutputService.html) - Typically this service is used to merge xml data with xdp template or pdf to generate flattened pdf. 
* [FormsService](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/forms/javadocs/com/adobe/fd/forms/api/FormsService.html) - This is a very versatile service which allows you to render xdp as pdf and  export/import data from and into PDF file.


The following code snippet exports data from PDF file

```java
javax.servlet.http.Part pdfPart = request.getPart("pdffile");
String filePath = request.getParameter("saveLocation");
java.io.InputStream pdfIS = pdfPart.getInputStream();
com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document pdfDocument = new com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document(pdfIS);
com.adobe.fd.forms.api.FormsService formsservice = sling.getService(com.adobe.fd.forms.api.FormsService.class);
com.adobe.aemfd.docmanager.Document xmlDocument = formsservice.exportData(pdfDocument,com.adobe.fd.forms.api.DataFormat.Auto);
```

Line 1 extracts  pdffile  from the request

Line2 extracts the saveLocation from the request

Line 5 gets hold of FormsService

Line 6 exports the xmlData from the PDF File

**To test the sample package on your system**

[Download and install the package using the AEM package manager](assets/using-output-and-form-service-api.zip)




**After you install the package you will have to allowlist the following URLs in Adobe Granite CSRF Filter.**

1. Please follow the steps mentioned below to allowlist the paths mentioned above.
1. [Login to configMgr](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
1. Search for Adobe Granite CSRF Filter
1. Add the following 3 paths in the excluded sections and save
1. /content/AemFormsSamples/mergedata 
1. /content/AemFormsSamples/exportdata 
1. /content/AemFormsSamples/outputservice 
1. /content/AemFormsSamples/renderxdp
1. Search for "Sling Referrer filter"
1. Check the "Allow Empty" check box. (This setting should be for testing purposes only)

## Testing the samples

There are a number of ways to test the sample code. The quickest and easiest is to use Postman app. Postman allows you to make POST requests to your server. 

* Install Postman app on your system. 
* Launch the app and enter the the appropriate URL
* Make sure you have selected "POST" from the drop down list
* Make sure you specify "Authorization" as "Basic Auth". Specify the AEM Server username and password
* Specify the request parameters in the body tab
* Click the Send button

The package contains 4 samples. The following paragraphs explain when to use the output service or Forms Service, the  url  of the service ,input parameters that each service expects
