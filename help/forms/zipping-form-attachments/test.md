# Steps needed to test the two approaches

* Configure [Day CQ Mail Service](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/administering/operations/notification.html?lang=en#configuring-the-mail-service) to send e-mails from AEM Forms server
* Deploy the [formattachments](assets/formattachments.formattachments.core-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar) bundle using [felix web console](http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles)

## Send zip file as an email attachment



* Deploy the [SendFormAttachmentsViaEmail workflow.](assets/zipped-form-attachments-model.zip) This workflow uses the send email component to send the zipped_attachments.zip file which is saved under the payload folder by the custom process step. Configure the senders' and recipients' email addresses according to your needs.
* Import the [sample form](assets/zip-form-attachments-form.zip) from [Forms And Document UI](http://localhost:4502/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments)
* [Preview the form](http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/zippformattachments/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled) and add a couple of attachments and submit the form.
* The workflow should get triggered and an email notification with the zip file should be sent.

## Send form attachments as individual files

* Deploy the [SendForm workflow.](assets/send-form-attachments-model.zip) This workflow uses send email component to send the form attachments as individual files. Configure the senders and recipients email address according to your needs.
* Import the [sample form](assets/send-list-attachments-form.zip) from [Forms And Document UI](http://localhost:4502/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments)
* [Preview the form](http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/sendlistofattachments/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled) and add a couple of attachments and submit the form.
* The workflow should get triggered and an email notification with the form attachments is sent.
