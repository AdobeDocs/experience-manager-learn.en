# Creating Acroform

Acroforms are forms created using Acrobat. You can create a new form from scratch using Acrobat or take an existing form created in Micrsoft Word and convert it into Acroform using Acrobat. The following steps need to be followed to convert a form created in Microsoft Word to Acroform.

* Open word document using Acrobat
* Use Acrobat Prepare form tool to identify the form fields on the form.
* Save the pdf. Make sure the file name does not have any spaces in it.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to send the fillable acroform for signing using Acrobat Sign, Please name the fields accordingly. For example, you could name a field **`Sig_es_:signer1:signature`**. This is the syntax Acrobat Sign understands.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are sending an XFA based document, you need to flatten the document and the Acrobat Sign signature tags need be present as static text in the document.
