``` json {.line-numbers}
[{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 10
},
{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 20
},
{
"category": "Travel",
"amount": 100
},
{
"category": "Gas",
"amount": 500
},
{
"category": "Gas",
"amount": 80
},
{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 30
},
{
"category": "Travel",
"amount": 200
}
 ]
 

 ```
