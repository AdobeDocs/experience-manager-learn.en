# Using Reducer Functions in AEM Forms - Charts{#using-reducer-functions-in-aem-forms-charts}

Reducer functions are used to aggregate or group values that are displayed in the chart.


For example, we can use the reducer functions to display the number of transactions per category, or display the highest expense per category from the sample data shown below

```json
[{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 10
},
{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 20
},
{
"category": "Travel",
"amount": 100
},
{
"category": "Gas",
"amount": 500
},
{
"category": "Gas",
"amount": 80
},
{
"category": "Groceries",
"amount": 30
},
{
"category": "Travel",
"amount": 200
}
]
```

The following video walks through the steps involved in using reducer functions.
