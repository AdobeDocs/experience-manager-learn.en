Form Data Model is dependent on a correctly configured Data Source. We will use the Data Source configured in the previous step as the basis for this Form Data Model.

Form Data Model is the basis for all your Interactive Communications. The Get/Read operation of the Form Data Model will fetch the data from your backend data source and is used to populate the Interactive Communications document.

For more information see [Configuring Data Sources](parttwo.md).

Once you have created Form Data Model, you can then use it as a basis for creating document fragments and Interactive Communication Documents.
