# How to enable creation of pdf files by merging large xml data files with xdp templates

When merging large xml data files with xdp template you may see the following error in the log file

``` txt

POST /services/OutputService/GeneratePdfOutput HTTP/1.1] com.adobe.fd.output.internal.exception.OutputServiceException AEM_OUT_001_003:Unexpected Exception: client timeout reached org.omg.CORBA.TIMEOUT: client timeout reached
```

To fix the above error do the following

## Change the aries timeout

* Stop AEM Server
* Create a folder called **install** under the crx-quickstart folder of your AEM installation
* Create a file called **org.apache.aries.transaction.config** with the following content
aries.transaction.timeout="1200"
 under install folder. You can change the timeout value as per your requirement. The timeout value is in seconds

 >[!NOTE]
 > Once you create the org.apache.aries.transaction configuration you can edit the transaction timeout values from the [configMgr](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr) instead of editing the file


## Change the Jacorb ORB provider settings

* [Open the OSGi ConfigMgr](http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
* Search for **Jacorb ORB Provider**
* Add the following entry 
jacorb.connection.client.pending_reply_timeout=600000
The above setting sets the pending reply timeout (also known as, CORBA client timeout) to 600 seconds.
* Save your changes
