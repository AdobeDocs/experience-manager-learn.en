# Prefill form with submitted data and attachments

When the **Administrator** clicks on the ViewLink in the search results table, the form is prefilled with the submitted data. 

A prefill service was used to fetch the data associated with the BlobId from Azure portal.

[A separate article on prefilling form with data and attachment is available here.](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/forms/prefill-form-with-data-attachments/introduction.html)
