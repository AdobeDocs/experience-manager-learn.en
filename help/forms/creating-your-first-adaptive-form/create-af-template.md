# Creating Adaptive Form Template

Every adaptive form is based on an adaptive form template. The template defines the structure, initial content, theme etc the adaptive form will inherit. You can create a new adaptive form template or use the out of the box template when creating your adaptive form.
The template created here will be the basis for our adaptive form going forward.
The following video shows you the basic process of creating adaptive form template
