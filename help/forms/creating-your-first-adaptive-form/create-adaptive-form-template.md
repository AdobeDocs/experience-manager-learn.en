# Creating Adaptive Form Template

Every adaptive form is based on an adaptive form template. The template defines the structure, initial content, theme etc., the adaptive form inherits. You can create a new adaptive form template or use the out of the box template when creating your adaptive form.
The template created here is the basis for our adaptive form going forward.
