# Getting Started With Adaptive Forms {#getting-started-with-adaptive-forms}

This tutorial will walk you through the steps involved in creating multi-tabbed Adaptive Form. You will learn to use Tables, Accordion Layout, and Rule Editor to author business rules. 

Adaptive forms allow you to create forms that are engaging, responsive, dynamic, and adaptive. AEM Forms provides an intuitive user interface and out-of-the-box components for creating and working with adaptive forms. You can choose to create an adaptive form based on a form model or schema or without a form model. It is important to carefully choose the form model that not only suits your requirements but extends your existing infrastructural investments and assets.

This tutorial does not use any form model in creating Adaptive Form.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

You will need the following:

* A working instance of AEM with Form Add-on package installed

* **It is assumed that you are running AEM Forms version 6.4 or above on localhost:4502.**

* [Download the client-libs-and-logo](assets/client-libs-and-logo.zip) and [getting-started-fragment](assets/getting-started-fragment.zip) to your hard drive.

* Import the zip files into AEM using [package manager ](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp)
