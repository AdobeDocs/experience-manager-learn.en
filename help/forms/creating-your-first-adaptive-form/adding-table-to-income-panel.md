## Make the Income Table Dynamic {#make-the-income-table-dynamic}

**Make sure you are in the edit mode. The edit button is located on the top right-hand side of the browser.**

* By default when you insert a table into Adaptive Form, the table is not dynamic meaning you cannot add new rows to the table at runtime.

* Refresh your browser.

* Select Row1 in the content hierarchy.

* Click on the wrench icon to open up the properties sheet.

* Set Minimum and Maximum count to 1 and 5 under the Repeat Settings and save your changes by clicking the blue check mark icon. This means the table can have a maximum of 5 rows. To have an indefinite number of rows set the maximum count to -1.
