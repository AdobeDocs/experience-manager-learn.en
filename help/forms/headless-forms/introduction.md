# Embedding Headless Adaptive Form

This article will cover the basics of embedding a headless adaptive form in your spa website. This article assumes you have an existing single-page app and would like to embed an adaptive form authored in AEM Forms 6.5.16 using core components.
Including a form in a Single Page App allows users to input and submit data seamlessly without the need for a page refresh. This enhances the interactivity and efficiency of the application.

The following screenshot shows a contact us form being embedded in SPA
