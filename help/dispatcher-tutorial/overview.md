# AEM Dispatcher Cache Tutorial

The Dispatcher is an essential part of most, if not all AEM installations. The goal of this tutorial is to help you better understand how the Dispatcher works and how you can work with it.

This tutorial is divided into three parts.

1. [Concepts, Patterns, and Antipatterns](chapter-1.md)
    Provides a brief introduction of the Dispatcher's history, mechanics and discusses how this influences how an AEM developer would design his components.

1. [Infrastructure Pattern](chapter-2.md)
    Discusses various topologies on how to scale up an AEM system with a cluster of Publish systems and Dispatcher caches in front.

1. [Advanced Caching Topics](chapter-3.md)
    Where the first two parts focused on plain http caching in the Dispatcher and what limitations there are. This part discusses some ideas on how to overcome these limitations.
