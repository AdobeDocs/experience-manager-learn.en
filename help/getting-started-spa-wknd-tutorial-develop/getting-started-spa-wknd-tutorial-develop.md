# Getting Started with the AEM SPA Editor - WKND Events Tutorial{#getting-started-with-the-aem-spa-editor-wknd-events-tutorial}

## The tutorials {#the-tutorials}

There are two parallel versions of the Getting started with AEM SPA Editor tutorial, building on a fictional **WKND Events** application; one that builds the integration using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and the [Angular](https://angular.io/). Other than the JavaScript frameworks used, both tutorials follow the same flow and build out the same capabilities.

Note the number and order of chapters in each tutorial varies based on the logical development flow imposed by the relevant framework.
