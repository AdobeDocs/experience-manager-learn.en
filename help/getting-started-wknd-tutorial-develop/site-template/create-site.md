# Create a site {#create-site}

As part of Quick Site Creation use the Site Creation Wizard in Adobe Experience Manager, AEM, to generate a new website. The Standard Site Template provided by Adobe, is used as a starting point for the new site.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

The steps in this chapter will take place in an Adobe Experience Manager as a Cloud Service environment. Ensure that you have administrative access to the AEM environment. It is recommended to use a [Sandbox program](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/getting-access/sandbox-programs/introduction-sandbox-programs.html) and [Development environment](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/implementing/using-cloud-manager/manage-environments.html) when completing this tutorial.

[Production program](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/using-cloud-manager/programs/introduction-production-programs.html) environments can be used for this tutorial as well; however, ensure that the activities of this tutorial will not affect the work being performed on the target environments, as this tutorial deploys content and code to the target AEM environment.

The [AEM SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/local-development-environment-set-up/aem-runtime.html) can be used for parts of this tutorial. Aspects of this tutorial that rely on cloud services, such as [deploying themes with Cloud Manager's front-end pipeline](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/getting-started-wknd-tutorial-develop/site-template/theming.html), cannot be performed on the AEM SDK.

Review the [onboarding documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/onboarding/home.html) for more details.

## Objective {#objective}

1. Learn to use the Site Creation Wizard to generate a new site.
1. Understand the role of Site Templates.
1. Explore the generated AEM site.

## Log in to Adobe Experience Manager Author {#author}

As a first step, log in to your AEM as a Cloud Service environment. AEM environments are split between an **Author Service** and a **Publish Service**.

* **Author Service** - where site content is created, managed and updated. Typically only internal users have access to the **Author Service** and is behind a login screen.
* **Publish Service** - hosts the live website. This is the service that end-users will see and is typically publicly available.

A majority of the tutorial will take place using the **Author Service**.

1. Navigate to the Adobe Experience Cloud [https://experience.adobe.com/](https://experience.adobe.com/). Log in using your Personal Account or a Company/School Account.
1. Ensure that the correct Organization is selected in menu and click **Experience Manager**.

1. Under **Cloud Manager** click **Launch**.
1. Hover over the Program you wish to use and click the **Cloud Manager Program** icon.

    ![Cloud Manager program icon](assets/create-site/cloud-manager-program-icon.png)

1. In the top menu click **Environments** to view the provisioned environments.

1. Find the environment you wish to use and click the **Author URL**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >It is recommended to use a **Development** environment for this tutorial.

1. A new tab is launched to the AEM **Author Service**. Click **Sign in with Adobe** and you should be logged in automatically with the same Experience Cloud credentials.

1. After being redirected and authenticated you should now see the AEM start screen.

## Download the Basic Site Template

A Site Template provides a starting point for a new site. A Site Template includes some basic theming, page templates, configurations and sample content. Exactly what is included in the Site Template is up to the developer. Adobe provides a **Basic Site Template** to accelerate new implementations.

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the Basic Site Template project on GitHub: [https://github.com/adobe/aem-site-template-standard](https://github.com/adobe/aem-site-template-standard). The project is open-sourced and licensed to be used by anyone.
1. Click **Releases** and navigate to the [latest release](https://github.com/adobe/aem-site-template-standard/releases/latest).
1. Expand the **Assets** dropdown and download the template zip file:

    ![Basic Site Template Zip](assets/create-site/template-basic-zip-file.png)

    This zip file is used in the next exercise.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > This tutorial is written using version **1.1.0** of the Basic Site Template. When starting a new project for production use, it is always recommended to use the latest version.

## Create a new site

Next, generate a new site using the Site Template from the previous exercise.

1. Return to the AEM environment. From the AEM Start screen navigate to **Sites**.
1. In the upper right-hand corner click **Create** > **Site (Template)**. This will bring up the **Create Site Wizard**.
1. Under **Select a site template** click the **Import** button.

    Upload the **.zip** template file downloaded from the previous exercise.

1. Select the **Basic AEM Site Template** and click **Next**.

    ![Select site template](assets/create-site/select-site-template.png)

1. Under **Site Details** > **Site title** enter `WKND Site`.

    In a real-world implementation "WKND Site" would be replaced by the brand name of your company or organization. In this tutorial, we are simulating the creation of a site for a ficticious lifestyle brand "WKND".

1. Under **Site name** enter `wknd`.

    ![Site Template details](assets/create-site/site-template-details.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > If using a shared AEM environment, append a unique identifier to the **Site Name**. For example `wknd-site-johndoe`. This will ensure that multiple users can complete the same tutorial, without any collisions.

1. Click **Create** to generate the Site. Click **Done** in the **Success** dialog when AEM has finished creating the web site.

## Explore the new site

1. Navigate to the AEM Sites console, if not already there.
1. A new **WKND Site** has been generated. It will include a site structure with a multi-lingual hierarchy.
1. Open the **English** > **Home** page by selecting the page and clicking the **Edit** button in the menu bar:

    ![WKND Site Hierarcy](assets/create-site/wknd-site-starter-hierarchy.png)

1. Starter content has already been created and several components are available to be added to a page. Experiment with these components to get an idea of the functionality. You will learn the basics of a component in the next chapter.

    *Sample content provided by the Site Template*

## Congratulations! {#congratulations}

Congratulations, you have just created your first AEM Site!

### Next Steps {#next-steps}

Use the Page editor in Adobe Experience Manager, AEM, to update content of the site in the [Author content and publish](author-content-publish.md) chapter. Learn how atomic Components can be configured to update content. Understand the difference between an AEM Author and Publish environments and learn how to publish updates to the live site.
