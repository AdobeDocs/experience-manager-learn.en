# Get started with AEM Sites - WKND tutorial {#introduction}

{{traditional-aem}}

Welcome to a multi-part tutorial designed for developers new to Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). This tutorial walks through the implementation of an AEM site for a fictitious lifestyle brand, the WKND. The tutorial covers fundamental topics like project setup, Core Components, Editable Templates, Client-side libraries, and component development with Adobe Experience Manager Sites.

## Overview {#wknd-tutorial-overview}

The goal for this multi-part tutorial is to teach a developer how to implement a website using the latest standards and technologies in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). After completing this tutorial, a developer should understand the basic foundation of the platform and common design patterns in AEM.

## Options for starting a Sites project

There are two basic approaches to starting an AEM Sites project.

**AEM Project Archetype** - Traditional approach to AEM development by generating a minimal AEM project using a Maven template. This is the recommended approach for AEM 6.5/6.4 projects and AEM as a Cloud Service projects that anticipate heavy customization. The tutorial offers a deeper dive into AEM development.

[Start the tutorial with the AEM Project Archetype](./project-archetype/overview.md)

**AEM Site Templates** - Also known as Quick Site Creation, a low-code approach to generating an AEM Site by using a pre-defined Site Template. Use out of the box components and templates to quickly get a site up and running. Use a theming workflow to apply brand-specific styles and customizations with just CSS and JavaScript. Recommended for new projects and developers. Only available for AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Adobe XD UI Kit

To make this tutorial closer to a real-world scenario Adobe's talented UX designers created the mockups for the site using [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). Over the course of the tutorial various pieces of the designs are implemented into a fully author-able AEM site. Special thanks to **Lorenzo Buosi** and **Kilian Amendola** who created the beautiful design for the WKND site.

## Reference Site {#reference-site}

A finished version of the WKND Site is also available as a reference: [https://wknd.site/](https://wknd.site/)

The tutorial covers the major development skills needed for an AEM developer but will *not* build the entire site end-to-end. The finished reference site is another great resource to explore and see more of AEM's out of the box capabilities.

To test the latest code before jumping into the tutorial, download and install the **[latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/aem-guides-wknd/releases/latest)**.
