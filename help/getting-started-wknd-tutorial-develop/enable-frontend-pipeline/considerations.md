# Development considerations

After enabling the front-end pipeline to only deploy the front-end resources in AEM as a Cloud Service environment, there is some impact on the local AEM development and you have to tweak the git branching model.

## Objective

* How to have a frictionless front-end and back-end development flow
* Review the dependencies between the full-stack and front-end pipeline


## Local development considerations

## Adjusted development approach

*   For the local development using AEM SDK, the back-end dev team still needs clientlib generation via `ui.frontend` module but during Cloud Manager deployment to AEM as a Cloud Service environment you have to skip it. This surfaces a challenge on how to isolate the project config changes outlined in the [Update Project](update-project.md) chapter.

A __solution__ could be to adjust your git branching model and making sure the AEM project config changes never flow back to the __local development__ branch the AEM back-end developers use.


*   As part of an ongoing enhancement to your AEM project, if you introduce new components or update an existing component that has changes in both `ui.app` and `ui.frontend` module, you have to run both full-stack and front-end pipelines.
