# Set up a Local AEM Development Environment 

Guide to setting up a local development for Adobe Experience Manager, AEM. Covers important topics of local installation, Apache Maven, integrated development environments and debugging/troubleshooting. Development with **[!DML Eclipse IDE], [!DNL CRXDE Lite], [!DNL Visual Studio Code] and [!DNL IntelliJ]** are discussed.

## Overview

Setting up a local development environment is the first step when developing for Adobe Experience Manager or AEM. Take the time to set up a quality development environment to increase your productivity and write better code, faster. We can break an AEM local development environment into 4 areas:

* Local AEM instances
* [!DNL Apache Maven] project
* Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
* Troubleshooting

## Install local AEM Instances

When we refer to a local AEM instance, we are talking about a copy of Adobe Experience Manager that is running on a developer’s personal machine. ***All*** AEM development should start by writing and running code against a local AEM instance.

If you are new to AEM, there are two basic run modes can be installed: ***Author*** and ***Publish***. The ***Author*** [runmode](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/deploying/using/configure-runmodes.html)  is the environment that digital marketers will use to create and manage content. When developing **most** of the time you will be deploying code to an Author instance. This allows you to create new pages as well as add and configure components. AEM Sites is a WYSIWYG authoring CMS and therefore most of the CSS and JavaScript can be tested against an authoring instance.

It is also *critical* test code against a local ***Publish*** instance. The ***Publish*** instance is the AEM environment that visitors to your website will interact with. While the ***Publish*** instance is the same technology stack as the ***Author*** instance, there are some major distinctions with configurations and permissions. Code should *always* be tested against a local ***Publish*** instance before being promoted to higher level environments.

### Steps

1. Ensure [Java](https://downloads.experiencecloud.adobe.com/content/software-distribution/en/general.html) is installed.
    * Prefer [Java JDK 11](https://experience.adobe.com/#/downloads/content/software-distribution/en/general.html?1_group.propertyvalues.property=.%2Fjcr%3Acontent%2Fmetadata%2Fdc%3AsoftwareType&1_group.propertyvalues.operation=equals&1_group.propertyvalues.0_values=software-type%3Atooling&orderby=%40jcr%3Acontent%2Fjcr%3AlastModified&orderby.sort=desc&layout=list&p.offset=0&p.limit=14) for AEM 6.5+
    * [Java JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html#JDK8) for AEM versions prior to AEM 6.5
2. Get a copy of the [AEM QuickStart Jar and a [!DNL license.properties]](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/deploying/using/deploy.html#GettingtheSoftware).
3. Create a folder structure on your computer like the following:

   ```plain
   ~/aem-sdk
       /author
       /publish
   ```

4. Rename the [!DNK QuickStart] JAR to ***aem-author-p4502.jar*** and place it beneath the `/author` directory. Add the ***[!DNL license.properties]*** file beneath the `/author` directory.
5. Make a copy of the [!DNL QuickStart] JAR, rename it to ***aem-publish-p4503.jar*** and place it beneath the `/publish` directory. Add a copy of the ***[!DNL license.properties]*** file beneath the `/publish` directory.

   ```plain
   ~/aem-sdk
       /author
           + aem-author-p4502.jar
           + license.properties
       /publish
           + aem-publish-p4503.jar
           + license.properties
   ```

6. Double-click the ***aem-author-p4502.jar*** file to install the **Author** instance. This will start the author instance, running on port **4502** on the local computer.

   Double-click the ***aem-publish-p4503.jar*** file to install the **Publish** instance. This will start the Publish instance, running on port **4503** on the local computer.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Depending on your development machine's hardware it may be difficult to have both an **Author and Publish** instance running at the same time. Rarely do you need to run both simultaneously on a local setup.

   For more information see [Deploying and Maintaining an AEM instance](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-5/sites/deploying/using/deploy.html).

## Install Apache Maven

***[!DNL Apache Maven]*** is a tool to manage the build and deploy procedure for Java-based projects. AEM is a Java-based platform and [!DNL Maven] is the standard way to manage code for an AEM project. When we say ***AEM Maven Project*** or just your ***AEM Project***, we are referring to a Maven project that includes all of the *custom* code for your site.

All AEM projects should be built off the latest version of the **[!DNL AEM Project Archetype]**: [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/aem-project-archetype). The [!DNL AEM Project Archetype] will create a bootstrap of an AEM project with some sample code and content. The [!DNL AEM Project Archetype] also includes **[!DNL AEM WCM Core Components]** configured to be used on your project.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>When starting a new project it is a best practice to use the latest version of the archetype. Keep in mind that there are multiple versions of the archetype and not all versions are compatible with earlier versions of AEM.

### Steps

1. Download [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
2. Install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) and ensure that the installation has been added to your command-line `PATH`.
    * [!DNL macOS] users can install Maven using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Verify that **[!DNL Maven]** is installed by opening a new command line terminal and executing the following:

   ```shell

   $ mvn --version
   Apache Maven 3.3.9
   Maven home: /Library/apache-maven-3.3.9
   Java version: 1.8.0_111, vendor: Oracle Corporation
   Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_111.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
   Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8

   ```

4. Add the **[!DNL adobe-public]** profile to your [!DNL Maven] [settings.xml](https://maven.apache.org/settings.html) file in order to automatically add **[!DNL repo.adobe.com]** to the maven build process.

5. Create a file named `settings.xml` at `~/.m2/settings.xml` if it doesn't exist already.

6. Add the **[!DNL adobe-public]** profile to the `settings.xml` file based on [the instructions here](https://repo.adobe.com/).

   A sample `settings.xml` is listed below. *Note, the naming convention of `settings.xml` and the placement beneath the user's `.m2` directory is important.*

   ```xml
   <settings xmlns="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
     xmlns:xsi="https://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="https://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0
                         https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

                        <updatePolicy>never</updatePolicy>
                    </releases>
                    <snapshots>
                        <enabled>false</enabled>
                    </snapshots>
                </repository>
            </repositories>
            <pluginRepositories>
                <pluginRepository>
                    <id>adobe-public-releases</id>
                    <name>Adobe Public Repository</name>
                    <url>https://repo.adobe.com/nexus/content/groups/public</url>

                </pluginRepository>
            </pluginRepositories>
        </profile>
   </profiles>
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>adobe-public</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
   </settings>
   ```

7. Verify that the **adobe-public** profile is active by running the following command:

    ```shell
    $ mvn help:effective-settings
    ...
    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>adobe-public</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
    <pluginGroups>
        <pluginGroup>org.apache.maven.plugins</pluginGroup>
        <pluginGroup>org.codehaus.mojo</pluginGroup>
    </pluginGroups>
    </settings>
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Total time:  0.856 s
    ```

    If you do not see the **[!DNL adobe-public]** it is an indication that the Adobe repo is not properly referenced in your `~/.m2/settings.xml` file. Please revisit the earlier steps and verify that the settings.xml file references the Adobe repo.

## Set Up an Integrated Development Environment

An integrated development environment or IDE is an application that combines a text editor, syntax support and build-tools. Depending on the type of development you are doing, one IDE might be preferable over another. Regardless of the IDE, it will be important to be able to periodically ***push*** code to a local AEM instance in order to test it. It will also be important to occasionally ***pull*** configurations from a local AEM instance into your AEM project in order to persist to a source-control management system like Git.

Below are a few of the more popular IDEs that are used with AEM development with corresponding videos that show the integration with a local AEM instance.

### [!DNL Eclipse] IDE

The **[[!DNL Eclipse] IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)** is one of the more popular IDEs for Java development, in large part because it is open source and ***free***! Adobe provides a plugin, **[[!DNL AEM Developer Tools]](https://eclipse.adobe.com/aem/dev-tools/)**, for [!DNL Eclipse] to allow easier development with a nice GUI to synchronize code with a local AEM instance. The [!DNL Eclipse] IDE is recommended for developers new to AEM in large part because of the GUI support by [!DNL AEM Developer Tools].

#### Installation and Setup

1. Download and install the [!DNL Eclipse] IDE for [!DNL Java EE Developers]: [https://www.eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/)
1. Follow the instructions to install the [!DNL AEM Developer Tools] plugin: [https://eclipse.adobe.com/aem/dev-tools/](https://eclipse.adobe.com/aem/dev-tools/)

* 10:55 - Pull code changes with AEM Developer Tool  
* 13:12 - Using the integrated debugging tools of Eclipse

### IntelliJ IDEA

The **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)** is a powerful IDE for professional Java development. [!DNL IntelliJ IDEA] comes in two flavors, a ***free*** [!DNL Community] edition and a commercial (paid) [!DNL Ultimate] version. The free [!DNL Community] version of [!DNL IntellIJ IDEA] is sufficient for more AEM development, however the [!DNL Ultimate] [expands its capability set](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

#### [!DNL Installation and Setup]

1. Download and install the [!DNL IntelliJ IDEA]: [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
1. Install [!DNL Repo] (command line tool): [https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/tools/tree/master/repo](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/tools/tree/master/repo#installation)

* 14:39 - Pull changes with Repo  
* 17:25 - Using the integrated debugging tools of IntelliJ IDEA

### [!DNL Visual Studio Code]

**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** has quickly become a favorite tool for ***front-end developers*** with enhanced JavaScript support, [!DNL Intellisense], and browser debugging support. **[!DNL Visual Studio Code]** is open source, free, with many powerful extensions. [!DNL Visual Studio Code] can be set up to integrate with AEM with the help of an Adobe tool, **[repo](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/tools/tree/master/repo#integration-into-visual-studio-code).** There are also several community-supported extensions that can be installed to integrate with AEM.

[!DNL Visual Studio Code] is a great choice for front-end developers who will primarily be writing CSS/LESS and JavaScript code to create AEM client libraries. This tool may not be the best choice for new AEM developers since node definitions (dialogs, components) will all need to edited in raw XML. There are several Java extensions available for [!DNL Visual Studio Code], however if primarily doing Java development [!DNL Eclipse IDE] or [!DNL IntelliJ] may be preferred.

### [!DNL CRXDE Lite]

[CRXDE Lite](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/developing-with-crxde-lite.html) is a browser-based view of the AEM repository. [!DNL CRXDE Lite] is embedded in AEM and allows a developer to perform standard development tasks like editing files, defining components, dialogs, and templates. [!DNL CRXDE Lite] is ***not*** intended to be a full development environment but is very effective as a debugging tool. [!DNL CRXDE Lite] is useful when extending or simply understanding product code outside of your code base. [!DNL CRXDE Lite] provides a powerful view of the repository and a way to effectively test and manage permissions.

[!DNL CRXDE Lite] should always be used in conjunction with other IDEs to test and debug code but never as the primary development tool. It has limited syntax support, no auto-complete capabilities and limited integration with source control management systems.

## Troubleshooting

***Help!*** My code isn't working! As with all development, there will be times (probably many), where your code is just not working as expected. AEM is a powerful platform, but with great power... comes great complexity. Below are a few high level starting points when it comes to troubleshooting and tracking down issues (but far from an exhaustive list of things that can go wrong):

### Verify Code Deployment

A good first step, when encountering an issue is to verify that the code has been deployed and installed successfully to AEM.

1. **Check [!UICONTROL Package Manager]** to ensure that the code package has been uploaded and installed: [http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp](http://localhost:4502/crx/packmgr/index.jsp). Check the time stamp to verify the package has been installed recently.  
1. If doing incremental file updates using a tool like [!DNL Repo] or [!DNL AEM Developer Tools], **check [!DNL CRXDE Lite]** that the file has been pushed to the local AEM instance and that the file contents are updated: [http://localhost:4502/crx/de/index.jsp](http://localhost:4502/crx/de/index.jsp)  
1. **Check that the bundle is uploaded** if seeing issues related to Java code in an OSGi bundle. Open the [!UICONTROL Adobe Experience Manager Web Console]: [http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles](http://localhost:4502/system/console/bundles) and search for your bundle. Ensure that the bundle has an **[!UICONTROL Active]** status. See below for more information related to troubleshooting a bundle in an **[!UICONTROL Installed]** state.

#### Check the Logs

AEM is a chatty platform and logs a lot of useful information in the **error.log**. The **error.log** can be found where AEM has been installed: < `aem-installation-folder>/crx-quickstart/logs/error.log`.

A useful technique for tracking down issues is to add log statements in your Java Code:

```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
...

public class MyClass {
    private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());

    ...

    String myVariable = "My Variable";

    log.debug("Debug statement of myVariable {}", myVariable);

    log.info("Info statement of myVariable {}", myVariable);
}
```

By default the **error.log** is configured to log *[!DNL INFO]* statements. If you want to change the log level you can do so by going to [!UICONTROL Log Support]: [http://localhost:4502/system/console/slinglog](http://localhost:4502/system/console/slinglog). You may also find that the **error.log** is too chatty. You can use the [!UICONTROL Log Support] to configure log statements for just a specified Java package. This is a best practice for projects, in order to easily separate custom code issues from OOTB AEM platform issues.

![Logging configuration in AEM](./assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/logging.png) 

#### Bundle is in an Installed state {#bundle-active}

All bundles (excluding Fragments) should be in an **[!UICONTROL Active]** state. If you see your code bundle in an [!UICONTROL Installed] state then there is an issue that needs to be resolved. Most times this is a dependency issue:

![Bundle Error in AEM](assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/bundle-error.png)

In the above screenshot the [!DNL WKND Core bundle] is an [!UICONTROL Installed] state. This is because the bundle is expecting a different version of `com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.models` than is available on the AEM instance. 

A useful tool that can be used is the [!UICONTROL Dependency Finder]: [http://localhost:4502/system/console/depfinder](http://localhost:4502/system/console/depfinder). Add the Java package name to inspect what version is available on the AEM instance:

![Core Components](assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/core-components.png)

Continuing with the above example, we can see that the version installed on the AEM instance is **12.2** vs **12.6** that the bundle was expecting. From there you can work backwards and see if the [!DNL Maven] dependencies on AEM match the [!DNL Maven] dependencies in the AEM project. In the above example [!DNL Core Components] **v2.2.0** is installed on the AEM instance but the code bundle was built with a dependency on **v2.2.2**, hence the reason for the dependency issue.

#### Verify Sling Models Registration {#osgi-component-sling-models}

AEM components should always be backed by a [!DNL Sling Model] to encapsulate any business logic and ensure that the HTL rendering script remains clean. If experiencing issues where the Sling Model cannot be found it may be helpful to check the [!DNL Sling Models] from the console: [http://localhost:4502/system/console/status-slingmodels](http://localhost:4502/system/console/status-slingmodels). This will tell you if your Sling Model has been registered and which resource type (the component path) it is tied to.

![Sling Model Status](assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/sling-model-status.png)

Shows the registration of a [!DNL Sling Model], `BylineImpl` that is tied to a component resource type of `wknd/components/content/byline`.

#### CSS or JavaScript Issues

For most CSS and JavaScript issues, using the browser's development tools is the most effective way to troubleshoot. To narrow down the issue when developing against an AEM author instance it is helpful to view the page "as Published".

![CSS or JS Issues](assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/css-and-js-issues.png)

Open the [!UICONTROL Page Properties] menu and click [!UICONTROL View as Published]. This will open the page without the AEM editor and with a query parameter set to **wcmmode=disabled**. This will effectively disable the AEM authoring UI and make troubleshooting/debugging front-end issues much easier.

Another commonly encountered issue when developing front-end code is old or outdated CSS/JS is being loaded. As a first step, ensure that the browser history has been cleared and if necessary start an incognito browsers or fresh session.

#### Debugging Client Libraries

With different methods of categories and embeds to include multiple client libraries it can be cumbersome to troubleshoot. AEM exposes several tools to help with this. One of the most important tools is [!UICONTROL Rebuild Client Libraries] which will force AEM to re-compile any LESS files and generate the CSS.

* [Dump Libs](http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.html) - Lists all of the client libraries registered in the AEM instance. &lt;host&gt;/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.html
* [Test Output](http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.test.html) - allows a user to see the expected HTML output of clientlib includes based on category. &lt;host&gt;/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.test.html
* [Libraries Dependencies validation](http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.validate.html) - highlights any dependencies or embedded categories that cannot be found. &lt;host&gt;/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.validate.html
* [Rebuild Client Libraries](http://localhost:4502/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.rebuild.html) - allows a user to force AEM to rebuild all of the client libraries or invalidate the cache of client libraries. This tool is particularly effective when developing with LESS as this can force AEM to re-compile the generated CSS. In general it is more effective to Invalidate Caches and then perform a page refresh versus rebuilding all of the libraries. &lt;host&gt;/libs/granite/ui/content/dumplibs.rebuild.html

![Debugging Clientlibs](assets/set-up-a-local-aem-development-environment/debugging-clientlibs.png)

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you are constantly having to invalidate the cache using the [!UICONTROL Rebuild Client Libraries] tool it may be worth it to do a one time rebuild of all client libraries. This may take around 15 minutes, but typically eliminates any caching issues in the future.
