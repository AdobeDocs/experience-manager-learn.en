# Use the CI/CD Pipeline in Adobe Cloud Manager

Adobe Cloud Manager provides a simple, yet flexible self-service CI/CD  Pipeline that allows AEM project teams to quickly, safely and consistently deploy code to all AEM environments hosted in AMS. This video series explores setting up and executing Cloud Manager's CI/CD Pipeline in both failure and success scenarios.

## Introduction

A cursory introduction to Cloud Manager and Cloud Manager Programs.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Throughout these videos, the build, test and deployment times has been sped up to reduce the time of the video. A complete pipeline execution typically takes 45 minutes or more (including the mandatory 30 minute performance testing), depending on the project size, number of AEM instances and UAT processes.

## Setting up the CI/CD pipeline

This video explores setting up the Pipeline for the Program in Cloud Manager.

## A failing pipeline execution

This video explores the execution of the CI/CD Pipeline using code that fails Cloud Manager's required quality checks, using the **[!DNL yellow]** repository branch.

## A successful pipeline execution

This video explores the successful execution of the CI/CD Pipeline using code that passes Cloud Manager's required quality checks, using the **[!DNL master]** repository branch.

This video also touches on the [!UICONTROL Activity] console in Cloud Manager, which allows re-entrance into active executions, or review of completed or failed executions.
