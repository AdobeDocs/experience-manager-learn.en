# JWT-To-OAuth credential migration for AEM

Learn how to migrate other Adobe solutions to the new OAuth Server-to-Server credentials from the deprecated Service Account (JWT) credentials.

While the Service Account (JWT) credentials have been marked as deprecated, they will continue to work until Jan 27, 2025. Therefore, you must migrate your application or integration to use the new OAuth Server-to-Server credential before Jan 27, 2025. For more information, please refer to the [migration guide](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/ServerToServerAuthentication/migration/).
