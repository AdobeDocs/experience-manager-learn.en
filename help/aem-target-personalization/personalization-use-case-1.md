# Personalization using AEM Experience Fragments and Adobe Target

With the ability to export AEM Experience Fragments into Adobe Target as HTML offers, you can combine the ease-of-use and power of AEM with powerful Automated Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities in Target to test and personalize experiences at scale.

AEM brings together all of your content and assets in a central location to fuel your personalization strategy. AEM lets you easily create content for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices in one location without writing code. There is no need to create pages for every device—AEM automatically adjusts each experience using your content.

Target lets you deliver personalized experiences at scale based on a combination of rules-based and AI-driven machine learning approaches that incorporate behavioral, contextual, and offline variables.  With Target, you can easily set up and run A/B and Multivariate (MVT) activities to determine the best offers, content, and experiences.

Experience fragments represent a huge step forward to link content creators with marketers who are driving business outcomes using Target.

## Scenario Overview

WKND site is planning to announce a **SkateFest Challenge** across America through their website and would like to have their site users sign up for the audition conducted in each state. As a marketer, you have been assigned the task to run a campaign on the WKND site home page, with banners messages relevant to the users' location and a link to the event details page. Let us explore the WKND site home page and learn how to create and deliver a personalized experience for a user based on his/her current location.

### Users Involved

For this exercise, the following users need to be involved and to perform some tasks you might need administrative access.

* **Content Producer / Content Editor** (Adobe Experience Manager)
* **Marketer** (Adobe Target / Optimization Team)

### Prerequisites

* **AEM**
  * [AEM author and publish instance](./implementation.md#getting-aem) running on localhost 4502 and 4503 respectively.
* **Experience Cloud**
  * Access to your organizations Adobe Experience Cloud - `https://<yourcompany>.experiencecloud.adobe.com`
  * Experience Cloud provisioned with the following solutions
    * [Adobe Target](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com)

### WKND Site Home Page

 ![AEM Target Scenario 1](assets/personalization-use-case-1/aem-target-use-case-1-4.png)

1. Marketer initiates the WKND SkateFest campaign discussion with AEM Content Editor and details the requirements.
   * ***Requirement***: Promote WKND SkateFest campaign on WKND site home page with personalized content for visitors from each state in the United States. Add a new content block beneath the Home Page Carousel containing a background image, text, and a button.
     * **Background Image**: Image should be relevant to the state from which the user is visiting the WKND Site page.
     * **Text**: "Sign Up for the Auditions"
     * **Button**: "Event Details" pointing to the WKND SkateFest Page
     * **WKND SkateFest Page**: a new page with event details, including the audition venue, date, and time.
1. Based on the requirements, AEM Content Editor creates an Experience Fragment for the content block and exports it to Adobe Target as an Offer. To serve personalized content for all states in the United States, content author can create one Experience Fragment master variation and then create 50 other variations, one for each state. Content for each state variation with relevant images and text can then be edited manually. When authoring an Experience Fragment, content editors can quickly access all the assets available within AEM Assets using the Asset Finder option. When an Experience Fragment gets exported to Adobe Target, all its variations are also pushed to Adobe Target as Offers.

1. After exporting Experience Fragment from AEM to Adobe Target as Offers, marketers can create an Activities in Target using these Offers. Based on the WKND site SkateFest campaign, marketer needs to create and deliver a personalized experience to WKND site visitors from each state. To create an Experience Targeting activity, the marketer needs to identify the audiences. For our WKND SkateFest campaign, we need to create 50 separate audiences, based on their location from which they are visiting the WKND website.
   * [Audiences](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/introduction/target-key-concepts.html#section_3F32DA46BDF947878DD79DBB97040D01) define the target for your activity and are used anywhere where targeting is available. Target audiences are a defined set of visitor criteria. Offers can be targeted to specific audiences (or segments). Only visitors who belong to that audience see the experience that is targeted to them.  For example, you can deliver an offer to an audience made up of visitors who use a particular browser or from a specific geo-location.
   * An [Offer](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/target/using/introduction/target-key-concepts.html#section_973D4CC4CEB44711BBB9A21BF74B89E9) is the content that gets displayed on your webpages during campaigns or activities. When you test your webpages, you measure the success of each experience with different offers in your locations. An Offer can contain different types of content, including:
     * Image
     * Text
     * **HTML**
       * *HTML Offers are used for this scenario's Activity*
     * Link
     * Button

## Marketer Activities

### Create an Audience with Geo-Targeting {#marketer-audience}

1. Navigate to your organizations [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experiencecloud.adobe.com/) (`<https://<yourcompany>.experiencecloud.adobe.com`)
1. Log in using your Adobe ID, and make sure you are in the correct Organization.
1. From the solution switcher, click on **Target** and then **launch** Adobe Target.

    ![Experience Cloud- Adobe Target](assets/personalization-use-case-1/exp-cloud-adobe-target.png)

1. Navigate to the **Offers** tab and search for "WKND" offers. You should be able to see the list of Experience Fragments variations, exported from AEM as HTML Offers. Each Offer corresponds to a state. For example, *WKND SkateFest California* is the offer that gets served to a WKND Site visitor from California.

    ![Experience Cloud- Adobe Target](assets/personalization-use-case-1/html-offers.png)

1. From the main navigation, click on **Audiences**.

   A Marketer needs to create 50 separate audiences for WKND site visitors coming from each state in the United States of America.

1. To create an audience, click on **Create Audience** button, and provide a name for your audience.

    **Audience Name format : WKND-\<*state*\>**

    ![Experience Cloud- Adobe Target](assets/personalization-use-case-1/audience-target-1.png)

1. Click **Add Rule > Geo**.
1. Click **Select**, then select one of the following options:
    * Country
    * **State** *(Select State for WKND Site SkateFest Campaign)*
    * City

    * DMA
    * Mobile Carrier

    **Geo** - Use audiences to target users based on their geographical location, including their country, state/province, city, zip/postal code, DMA, or mobile carrier. Geolocation parameters allow you to target activities and experiences based on your visitors' geography. This data is sent with each Target request and is based on the visitor's IP address. Select these parameters just like any targeting values.

    >[!NOTE]
    >A visitor's IP address gets passed with a mbox request, once per visit (session), to resolve geo targeting parameters for that visitor.

1. Select the operator as **matches**, provide an appropriate value (For eg: California) and **Save** your changes. In our case, provide the state name.
