Tags in Adobe Experience Platform is used expose Adobe Target on the public facing Web site experience served by AEM.

In order to use AEM Experience Fragment offers to power you personalization activities, lets proceed to the next chapter, and integrate AEM with Adobe Target using the legacy cloud services. This integration is required to push Experience Fragments from AEM to Target as HTML/JSON offers and to keep the target offers in sync with AEM. This integration is required for implementing [Scenario 1 discussed in the overview section](./overview.md#personalization-using-aem-experience-fragment).

## Prerequisites
